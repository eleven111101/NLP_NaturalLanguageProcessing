Outdoor Enthusiast,"A bag helps with carrying the Outland Firebowl, keeps the car clean, and holds all content inside. It also helps protect the Firebowl against the environmental effects (dirt, moisture, etc.) The bag fits the 863 Cypress / 864 Costco version perfectly. The material was pleasantly well-made, and the front, zippered pouch is generously large. It is a lot better than the DnxHone-made one I previously bought for the 893 Deluxe. Priced much lower at $25 vs $36 for the official bag. The official bag is better-padded."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"A bit over 3 years ago, I purchased the 50' Forever Steel Hose after seeing an infomercial for it and seeing it available on Amazon as a Lightning Deal. I was tired of hoses always leaking over time, and the Steel Hose actually became my best one I had purchased. They are PRICEY, but they are extremely sturdy and do not kink. It also was quite lightweight and really strong. My parents got a big backyard and the 30' would be long enough. Decided to give this brand a try. It actually looks and works the same as the Forever Steel one but at a slightly lower price. Either brand works great. I have several different brand metal hoses at my own home and have not had to replace them in... 6-8 years."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"After having tried the Blackberry Bellini and finding myself liking it (I'm not a fan of fruity tea) because of its predominantly pineapple/lemon flavor, I tried this Pineapple Sangria next. Was it good? Surprisingly... yes. Per the instructions, white tea should be seeped at 175F for 3-5 mins. That is quite an aggressive temperature, but well, I am not an expert with white tea and went with it. This tea, too, had a pineapple/rosy flavor profile and well, as I had said before, I actually liked it. My wife, on the other hand -- she LOVES it."
Ronny Acosta,"After overplucking and waxing, I bought this to help me figure out what looks good and where my eyebrows should be. The amount and variety of eyebrow stencils may seem like a lot but I am thankful because it allowed me to figure out which shape looks great on me. When it came to choosing one, I had it narrowed down to 4 and from there, I just took an eyebrow pencil and ""colored"" in my eyebrows. If I didn't like it, I just washed it off and started all over again. I was then able to narrow it down to 2 and had one on each eyebrow. The shaping wax really does make my eyebrows pop and with the help of the stencil, my eyebrows really do shape my eyes. The shaver that comes with this kit is sharp and really does help shave off those small hairs that I can never pluck or wax off. While my hair is still growing out, using this stencil every day doesn't add more time when it comes to getting ready. It actually helps cut my time since I'm not having to constantly do my eyebrows over and over again. I should also mention, the elastic strap that comes with this, really does help keep the stencil in place and fits anyone. Even my daughter has started using these and they have helped her too. Whether you're a beginner or do eyebrows daily, these stencils really do help when it comes to shaping. Plus you're able to actually see if that shape looks good on you or not."
Ronny Acosta,"After using this during a very cold hiking trip, this thing not only kept my hands warm but lasted throughout our whole hiking trip with some battery left over. This fits in really any pocket, whether it was my sweater, jacket or even my pants. I at first thought it was going to be too warm or possibly burn my skin but I'm able to easily choose the heat setting. The lowest setting was a great way for me to slowly get used to having the heat in my pocket but I mainly kept it on the second setting as this not only kept my hands warm but even while in my pocket, it helped to keep my body warm. The highest setting wasn't too hot but was a bit too warm for where I was at. However, I can see that setting coming in handy for the snow. Really easy to use and really does keep you warm and toasty."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Along with a stretchable band, I use twist ties to hold plants together -- like tomato vines and flowers (such as Orchids). Cutting the wires with the built-in clipper is easy, but the big issue with all of these is that they tend to unravel and become a pain to keep contained in the original packaging."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Although I like BBQ sauces that are just sweet or just spicy, I especially enjoy them combined! This brand tastes pretty good and sells for a good price. However, it is not as good as Sweet Baby Ray's or Stubb's. Nonetheless, it is really good on baked or grilled chicken breasts, chicken tenders, and ribs. The heat it packs is a good kick."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Amazon Basics brand tries to produce products that are similar to name-brand ones but at a lower price. They sometimes may even use the same supplier as sellers purportedly have to disclose their sources to be able to sell on Amazon. With that said, this scraper works as expected and made tile, vinyl, and glue removable easy. It feels decent and solid in the hands and provides a good grip. The last part is important as you do not want to slip while scraping something -- I had nearly cut my finger off before while removing some sharp items and slipped because I was not paying attention."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"AmazonBasics is Amazon's own brand that aims to sell popular items at a lower price with similar quality. This hacksaw unexpectedly worked better than I expected. It felt hefty and solid, blade changed easily, and it was very rigid where I did not feel like an accident could happen. The blade itself, however, was slightly misaligned, but after a few adjustments, it worked fine. I bought myself better replacement blades than what came with this product. The hacksaw frame itself is good."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"AmazonBasics tries to produce alternatives to brand names at a slightly lower price. It is an Amazon-owned brand. This recycle bin is no exception as it feels very strong and sturdy and is virtually indistinguishable from another commercial name my parents use at their donut shop. With that said, I wanted a tall, narrow recycle bin for use at our home to fit a tight space. It does just that. Generous amount of storage capacity to hold all of our weekly recyclables (mail, plastics, cardboard) before getting emptied out into our house recycle bin."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"As a parent of two children under the age of six, watching them while preparing camp and food can be difficult. First, I had purchased a slackline kit to set up a rudimentary zipline earlier this year and it was a BLAST for all the children. They had a LOT of fun despite the 100F+ heat. All we had to do was ensure they were hydrated. Next came this rocket launching kit. Kept some of the kids busy for a few hours too as long as they stood in line and competed with one another how far they could power the rockets. Setup was simple: hook up the pump and hose, adjust the launcher angle, and let the kids go at it. They jump onto the pump, rocket launches, we keep track of where it landed, then make them go retrieve to stand back in line for their turn. Best part: they fell asleep quickly at night due to the exhaustion. Win-Win for parents and kids."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"As expected, turns black cup into a hero-esque, white color scheme with heat and revealing the World's best Super Dad. Holds and feels like a normal cup otherwise."
Ronny Acosta,"As I'm writing this review, I'm currently wearing this nightgown. Since getting this, it has been my go to nightgown because of how comfortable it is and great during these hot nights. It still gets pretty hot, even at night and this nightgown is very breathable. I ordered this in a XXL which is the same size of tops that I wear and this fits with room. I wasn't wanting something tight on me and this is perfect. The fabric is completely soft and feels great on. When it comes to washing, this has been worn a lot and even with all the washing and drying, this nightgown still looks new and has not started falling apart like some nightgowns that I own. The sleeves are a 3/4 sleeve and if needed, I'm able to pull them up if I need to. I would recommend people getting their normal size, unless you are wanting something a little tighter than I suggest going down a size. I stand about 5'4"" and this hits right at the bottom of my knees. So comfortable to wear and can see myself still wearing this during the winter months."
Ronny Acosta,"As long as my kids get all the toys on the part that lays down, when it comes to cleaning up, this bag makes it so much easier. Even with the mess that my kids usually make with playing with their toys, if they end up playing with them on the mat, it just makes it that much easier to clean up. However, rather than just dumping toys inside of this bag, the mat helps keep the toys inside of this storage bag. The best part about this bag is that even if my kids knock this bag over, no toys spill out all over the place. The quality of the material that this bag is made of is a lot stronger than I thought it was. Even with some of their toys that do have some sharp edges and are pointy, nothing has penetrated through the mat or bag. This bag can hold quite a bit of toys, but that also depends on the sizes of them. Not only makes storing a lot easier but more importantly, cleaning them up too."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"As you probably already know, the bee population has been on a steep decline. For a backyard fruit orchard, this is sad news. Planting flowers helps encourage bees to visit, and indeed they did. We have quite a lot more fruit growing now than we did in the past, two years. Sprinkle the seeds as directed and keep the dirt moist. Saw some seedlings grow in as little as two days. Over a period of the past 3 weeks or so, we have started seeing some flowers bloom, though we don't know what all of them are. The package describes that different flowers will grow over time, some of which are annuals and others are perennials (they'll keep growing every year). Great! That will hopefully encourage bees to keep visiting throughout the year to help pollinate fruit trees that are ready at different times throughout the seasons. Additionally, the flowers give a nice look to the garden."

Ronny Acosta,"At first I didn't think this was going to work for my desk but it really does work great. With the seasons changing, my allergies have been bothering me a lot more than normal and this humidifier has been helping me. While I do have a small/decent sized office, this humidifier is perfect for me. Filling this is really easy to do but I do fill this with filtered water rather than tap. When it comes to using, I have noticed a difference not just in my office but with my breathing too. Normally my nose is itchy, dry and really bothering me but since using this, while I'll still occasionally sneeze, my nose doesn't feel so dry inside anymore. The bonus for me with this humidifier is there is no watery mess or leaking with this. The mist that comes out isn't too fine but not heavy enough that is makes a mess on my desk or area. Hardly takes up any space and perfect for my office."
Ronny Acosta,"At first I was afraid taking this outside as I thought the kids might lose it, but it is safe to take outside. As for in the house use, we found that this is also safe for in house as if it does hit the walls or ceiling, it doesn't do any damage. However, with that being said, do make sure that ceiling fans are turned off before using inside the room. When it comes to using, my kids and I are able to either have this follow our hands or we can use it similar to a frisbee and toss it to each other. This does glide through the air pretty good but the only downside is the longest we've been able to play with this was almost 15 minutes but it does charge fairly fast. When it comes playing, you can either play with this with others or by yourself because this also acts as a boomerang too. Really a lot of fun to use and great that it doesn't damage or leave marks on our walls or ceiling."
Ronny Acosta,"At first I was completely skeptical about this working but to my surprise it really does. We were having issues with some to the electrical work that we had done and found that a lot of the wiring was not only done incorrectly but were huge fire hazards. What was really convenient about this reader is I didn't have to tear down my walls in order for this reader to work either. This reader does come with batteries so it was ready to use right out of the box. I tested this on my phone and it automatically read the volts that was being emitted from my phone. I then tested this on a bluetooth speaker and once again, it came up once again. That is when I tried this on my wall and automatically, the volts started going up higher than what they should be. Even with using this almost all day, this not once killed the batteries that it came with so it doesn't waste battery life. Really easy to hold and is light weight. But more importantly, this really does work."
Ronny Acosta,"At first I was looking for a necklace with an initial until I saw the horseshoe. I ended up buying this hoping it would arrive better in the picture and it did not disappoint. The chain itself is really comfortable to wear and really easy to put on. Whether I have fake or real nails on, I'm able to still put on the clasp even with it being kind of small and dainty. The chain does have the .925 sterling silver stamp on it. The chain doesn't get knotted or caught up in my hair like some chains have. The charm on this necklace looks so much better in person than what it does in the picture. The inlay on this has a similar look like turquoise and actually looks like a horseshoe. No matter how much I wear this out, I have not had this necklace discolor my skin or tarnish. Absolutely love the look of this necklace and the quality."
Ronny Acosta,"At first when I read that this only goes 10 mph, I didn't think much of it. However, when I'm on this running, that 10 mph is really fast. The fastest I've gone on this is about 7 and I feel as though I have to watch myself so I don't fall. When it comes to saving space, this treadmill really does help save on space. The track part folds up and even with it being at an angle, it saves a lot more space if I were to leave it laying down. Moving this up against my wall is really easy to do, but I have tile floors that this easily moves across when I try to move it. There is a safety device on this that even if you do fall, once that magnet is removed from the display area, this treadmill will slow down really fast. There are several different options when it comes to using this treadmill. I have done it where I choose the speed and incline, run with no incline, walk, light jog or use the options that are already programed into the treadmill. When you choose one of the programs, the treadmill will automatically speed up, slow down go up and down on it's own. While there are a total of 12, I have only done 3 of them. I have now owned and used this treadmill for about 2 months now. Not only is it going strong but even with several people in my family who have used it, this thing is still working like it did the first day we set it up. The other security feature I love about this treadmill is it will not work unless the main power switch on the bottom is turned on. If that is turned on and the magnet clip is on the display, I'm able to turn this on and start using immediately. Even with the main power switch on, if that magnet clip is not on the display, this treadmill will turn on but the track will not move. Love the safety features and how much space it save. Really easy to use and I'm still able to hold my drink in the holder without it falling over or me falling just to get it."
Ronny Acosta,"At first when I tried using this, I thought it was broken and was going to return it. However, it wasn't the dryer but a plug inside of my house that didn't work anymore and needed to be changed out. The dryer itself works great and love that it comes with so many attachments. While I still haven't used all of them, I have owned this for over 3 months now, but the ones I have used work great. What I love about this dryer is that it doesn't leave my hair looking dry, frizzy or flat. I will use this to dry my hair, press the button and twist off the dryer attachment and then change it out for whichever attachment I am needing. Once the attachment is locked in place, none of them have come loose or even came off while I was using it. My favorite have been the curling ones because they really to give me a more bouncy curl and do not fry my ends. Really easy to use and have taken this on many trips."
Ronny Acosta,"At first when this came in, I wasn't sure how these lights were going to look. Just because of the paint that was on them. However, once I added these to the rest of my garland and other decorations, it actually looks like cracked and kind of spooky skulls. Once the lights are on, that is when the lights kind of come to life. During the day, they look like just part of my garland, as the cords allowed me to wrap the garland within the cord itself. These lights are really easy to maneuver and the skulls are easy to adjust. These do require batteries but found that these don't drain the batteries at all. The lights themselves, once they're on, they don't heat up and don't melt my garland. Love that these don't require a plug as they can be used anywhere, plus they don't waste batteries. Great quality lights and the paint doesn't chip off either."
Ronny Acosta,"Before my desk was cluttered as the cups that I had to hold everything were overfilled and would fall over easily. With this desk organizer, everything that I want and need is all in one spot. Rather than having a holder for my paper clips, a holder for pens, losing my stapler and paperwork going from one side to under my desk, this organizer helps to keep everything in one spot. What was really nice is this actually came with paperclips. The drawer comes out which has not only made it convenient to store my paperclips but I no longer spill them everywhere. I'm even able to keep my stapler in one spot without losing it. Even my tape dispenser fits on top of where the paperclips go. This has not only cleared up space on my desk, but I no longer misplace or spill things."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"C is for Cookie, that's good enough for me! C is for Cookie, that's good enough to eat! (Sing along with Cookie Monster!) These cookies are great! They come in a solid, metallic box and were still fresh when we opened it. The Zebra one is my personal favorite among the flavors. These taste good, but they are a bit on the sweet side (as most cookies are). Maybe not as good as homemade, but very tasty. (This is my HONEST opinion. I was not paid nor compensated in any way for my review.)"
Ronny Acosta,"Compared to my last lunch bag, this lunch bag has so much more room. I'm actually able to pack food inside of this bag without anything getting smashed. Even when I have a can of soda, bag of chips, cookies and a sandwich, not only is there more than enough room but nothing is broken and I actually have a non-smashed sandwich. When it comes to keeping my food cold, it really does keep my lunch cold and everything stays cold. I have a small ice pack that I usually have in my lunch bag and even by the time I get off of work, the ice pack is still cold. What I didn't think I would care is the bottom pegs. This not only helps protect the bottom of my lunch bag but the bottom has a protective lining on the outside that helps prevent anything from getting inside of my bag. I'm even able to carry a few extra things on the outside without having to take up space on the inside. Love this lunch bag and can now actually enjoy a cold lunch when I'm not able to put it in the fridge at work."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Compared to some of the fire starter kits I have (ferro + magnesium), this one works just as well but with some extras built in. It is waterproof (as are all of them), and has a nice, solid grip. Prime the ferro rod a bit, and each strike produced a good amount of spark. Be sure to shave the magnesium as finely as possible for a good spark. The bellow helps concentrate your breath onto a smaller area to help stoke fire from a safe distance and from near its center. The striker has measurements built-in, but I wish they were in miles instead. It serves a multi purpose, including as a bottle opener (not that it would be particularly useful in a survival situation, but some need their beer to survive!), mini screwdriver, and whatever your creativity can think of. Be sure to practice your fire-making skills before you put this away in your Bug Out bag. Nothing worse than when you're hungry, in an emergency situation, and not knowing how to make your fire because you never practiced."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Crushes garlic through with ease, adding some minced flavor to your dishes. Cleanup can be a bit of a pain, however, and so be sure you have a spray available to blast through the holes."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Depending on your handlebar, installation can be easy or time consuming. The easiest would be if your handlebar already has a way to screw on the mirrors. Done, good to go. The harder part is if the rubber handles themselves cannot be screwed onto -- this will then require finesse and patience to place the mirrors through the handles' rubber so they can stay on securely. It's not an impossible task, but be aware that some installations may be more time consuming than others. Once in place, the mirrors can be rotated to the desired angles for an ""objects are closer than they appear"" type of rear view."
Ronny Acosta,"Even after using this ball for almost 2 months, this ball is still going strong. My last one didn't make it past 3 weeks but no matter who uses this and for however stretches get used for this ball, it's still holding strong. Even after my dog attempting to take this outside through the small doggy door, there was no leaking or holes created. When using this, I was able to use a plug in pump but if someone does use one, make sure to watch carefully so it doesn't become overfilled. I haven't sat on this but I have been able to put both of my feet on this to help with planking and doing pushups. While the ball will bounce and hold strong, I did find that if the floor is wet, it will slip. However, I do have tile floors and found that it will only slip when the floor is wet. Other than that, no sliding or slipping. Great quality and really does help when it comes to working out."
Ronny Acosta,"Even with the sun beating on these decorations, they are not only still brightly colored but still standing tall in my front yard. They came with plastic sticks that I was able to easily insert into each cutout. I did have to water my yard a bit extra to get them to go in because the yard was a little too dry but once the ground was moist enough, I was able to stick the stakes inside into the ground. They stand perfectly tall and have not once started to lean or break. I love that they are not too big and not too small. After placing these in the ground, I did walk across the street and these can be seen from across the street. You can actually see what each cutout is. These are fully waterproof as my sprinklers do hit these every time they come on. No matter how much water hits these cutouts and the sun, these still look great."
Ronny Acosta,"Every year I go with a theme for my tree and this year I chose silver. However, I have a little one in the house now and what I love about these ornaments is that they're plastic. Plus, I did have to downsize my tree and with the amount that I got, there was more than enough to decorate my whole tree. The glitter ones really do help give my plain tree that sparkle that I was looking for. The matte ones are perfectly matte and the shiny have a design in them so they don't look so plain. These did come with strings attached to them, however, I was able to remove and put my own strings/ribbon on them. When using the glitter ones, they do shed a bit, but I was able to spray and seal them which helped stopped the glitter from getting everywhere. Other than that, these ornaments are perfect and love that even if you drop them, they don't shatter or cave in."
Ronny Acosta,"First off, this recliner was delivered in one box but the top and bottom where not attached. After removing both sections, what I noticed is that these are packaged so well that they even covered each section with a pretty thick bag that prevents any sort of damage while shipping. The other thing I noticed about this recliner, is that the top actually zips to the bottom. I've ordered other chairs before and none of them have ever had a zipper that ensures the top and bottom pieces do not come apart. Putting this together was really easy but I do recommend reclining the top part of the chair in order to get to the zipper, it's a lot easier. When it comes to the recliner itself, it has a really great slick and modern look to it. While it kind of looks bulky, it really isn't. It is full and very well cushioned, but it's not overly done. The legs on this recliner are very sturdy and fully attached to this recliner. I love that the bottom part of the leather isn't rubbing against my floors either. The recliner is really comfortable to sit in and really has an upright position which I like. If I want to just recline my feet, I'm able to easily do so. If I want to fully recline, I just push the back more and I'm in a full recline. I have fallen asleep many times in this recliner because of how comfortable this recliner is. The one thing I was really surprised about this recliner is even if I'm just sitting upright, the cushions in the back actually give me full lumbar and neck support. Not only does this look great in my living room, especially how modern it looks but more importantly how comfortable this recliner is. Highly recommend and the stitching on this recliner does not come loose either with the constant use this chair gets."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"First things first: this pad requires to be heated in a microwave. And typical for these types of pads, the warmth only stays temporarily for about 20-30 minutes. That gives you enough to relax your aching muscles a bit -- and it felt really good on my lower back -- but if you wanted more, you would have to head back to the microwave and do it all again. So, if you desire more, you may want to look into an electrical, heated blanket/pad instead. Or as was in my case, I was looking for something convenient to take camping to keep my kid warm with during the colder evenings. This product would not be it. The electric blanket would also not be suitable even though I have battery power stations available, but that would be a waste of electricity. If you want to have warmth that lasts for HOURS, the hot water bottle still is the best method, especially if it is insulated. For instance, I took one car camping (boondocking) in late November last year where temperatures dipped to 38F by the time we went to sleep in our own cars, and the morning was 27F! The hot water bottle actually was still WARM. So, it really depends on what you are looking for. A microwaveable heating pad is good, but only when you are home. I have and recommend the Peter Pan 100oz hot water bottle, in case you were wondering."
Ronny Acosta,"First, I love that I'm still able to use our old weight bench with these weights. When we have this as a long bar, we're able to actually rest these weights on it. This also makes it so much easier to change the weight too. Next, the padding on this bar not only protects our hands but also ensures that even with sweaty hands, we don't drop the weights. I don't like using gloves and found that the padding not only doesn't cut up my hand or create blisters but even when my hands are sweaty, I don't feel as though I'm going to drop it either. The weights themselves are really heavy duty and easy to hold. Not only are these great for working out but after my shoulder injury, they have been a really great help when it comes to physical therapy at home. I love that I don't have to use the bar when I don't need to and they're still light enough that I don't hurt myself all over again. When it comes to switching out the weights, it's not only easy to do but even switching from a long to short bar is just as simple. Love that even when I'm using this, they don't come unscrewed either."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"First, I love the color. It is bright and visible -- important for when you are out on the water and boats coming by. Obviously, life vests are the most important, but having other visible items with you adds to it. I own both this dedicated kayak paddle and the company's SUP/Kayak convertible. Unlike the convertible one, this is specifically made for kayaking, and as such feels much more comfortable to grip without that pesky locking mechanism bump found with the other. It also is designed squarely for better kayak efficiency. Whenever I know that I will be purely kayaking with my iSUP (and seat attachment), I would bring this paddle. If I wanted to be more recreational and switch between SUP or kayak, I'd bring the convertible. I purchased some D-Ring clips to attach the paddle to the side of my iSUP for added convenience. That way I could actually bring two paddles with me."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"First, I'd like to share that the bottle, despite packaged seemingly well in bubble wrap, arrived with the cap dented that stopped the bottle from being sealed. Juices leaked out and that caused us concerns about whether it was still safe to consume the content. It was shipped by Amazon, and Amazon unfortunately did not provide the option to return it for a replacement unless I spoke to a human. I reached out to the seller instead, and right away a new bottle was sent out with even better wrapping. Second, how did this taste? Beet-based ketchup with no tomatoes? I was surprised... VERY surprised. It tasted VERY close to ketchup. Less sugar, less salt, and ingredients you recognize. My son and mother-in-law agreed. We all actually liked it a lot. Customer service was great, ""ketchup"" was tasty and close to tomato-based ones, and healthier ingredients. What's there not to like? Well, price. Hopefully, this company can scale it out more and get the price lowered with further mass production. I think that this company has a hit if they can out market Heinz."
Ronny Acosta,"First, these fit inside of my Toyota Corolla as my headrests are detachable. I was going to use these in my other car but realized that my headrests are fully attached. However, the great thing about these is where I park at work, the inside of my car is hit with sunlight all day until I leave. Even with the daily sunlight, these seat covers have not cracked, peeled or chipped away. These were really easy to install onto my seats too. No matter how many times I get in and get out of my car, these covers are still attached onto my seats. These really don't move or slide around on my seats either. What I didn't think these seats were going to offer is a little padding that actually helps since my seats are getting a little worn. Really comfortable seat covers and great quality of material too."
Ronny Acosta,"First, this did take a bit to install this as I had to adjust it a few times in order to get the view and angle I was wanting and needing. Once it was installed, I was able to connect everything which didn't take that long. The longest for me was figuring out where the best place to install this on my trailer. The other thing I noticed is that even though the ""visor"" on the backup camera is small, it actually does block out the sunlight from glaring in this camera and allows me to always backup into our camping spot without arguing with anyone. The picture quality on the screen is really clear. The one thing that has helped out immensely are the lines that show up, especially when I'm trying to fit into a tight spot. Since installing this camera, I have not had any issues with going over any barriers. The only complaint that I have with this backup camera is I wish it came with a screen protector for the screen but I was able to buy one for a tablet and just trim it to fit on this. Really easy to install and has come in handy more times than I can count."
Ronny Acosta,"First, this shirt is true to size. I wear a size XXL in my shirts and ordered a XXL and it fits like my other XXL shirts. The shirt itself is breathable and really comfortable to wear. There is some stretch to this shirt which is great because I am on the busty side. This not only fits all over but even my chest without being see through. I thought for sure since I ordered black there was going to be a possibility of fading but after a month, no fading, no shrinking and no falling apart. I have paired this shirt with a variety of shorts and even pants. No matter what I wear this shirt with, it looks great. I'm even able to dress it up if need be. Really a comfortable shirt to wear and love that when I raise my hands up, it doesn't come up and show my stomach. Great quality of fabric and love how it feels."
Ronny Acosta,"First, this tent is really easy to setup. Once the tent itself is setup, this tent is super sturdy. Even with some wind blowing, this thing doesn't really move, but the stakes that comes with this tent really help with that. When it comes to room and space, I can only comment about 2 people. When it comes to space, it is more than room for 2 people to fit inside of this tent. We not only had our inflatable mattress pad, sleeping bags and duffle bag with clothes and shoes but we did have our lab in the tent and there was still space left over. The weather was cold at night but somewhat warm during the day and when this tent is open with the net closed, it really does allow a good breeze to come in and help cool inside. However, at night, we did stay nice and warm throughout. We have not had any issues with rain but even with the mist that was around, we stayed dry inside. When it came to taking this down, just as easy to take down as it is to put up. Plus the carrying bag really does hold this tent and everything inside without tearing or ripping."
Ronny Acosta,"First, when this came in, I decided to take pictures of what it looks like coming out of the box. Reason for this is the way it was delivered, everything was not only protected but when it came to putting this together, it was really easy. It didn't look sturdy at all when I took this frame out of the box but once it's all put together, not only is it sturdy but it really holds up very well. I bought this for a spare bedroom and we have a full sized bed. Not only does this frame fit our mattress but we were able to get rid of the box spring that came with it. The storage underneath is so much more than what we had before. We were able to put extra sheets and blankets in a bag and store them underneath which cleared out a lot of room in the closet. Even with all of that, we still have more than enough room to store anything else we want to. Even when you sleep on this, you don't feel any of the bars that go across the frame. Whether you're getting on, getting off or just moving around on the bed, no squeaking and the frame doesn't move around like it's going to fall apart. The feet on the this bed frame has not once scratched our wooden floors either. We're able to move this bed around, so we can vacuum underneath and while it can be move around on our floors, it doesn't scratch them up. This bed frame not only offers full support but love the amount of storage it allows us to have underneath. When it comes to putting this bed together, I ended up using my own tools because it was a lot easier. The instructions it came with were kind of basic but separating the parts and doing the base of the frame first really helps. Not to mention, having someone else to help hold things also helps."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Fits my 1.5 year old daughter well and the bright, blue color is very pleasant to look at. Has a mesh lining inside to promote air flow by keeping the solid textile off the head. Lanyard to keep hat from being blown away by a strong gust of wind."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Fits my 5-year-old son well. Lenses are polarized and can also be verified with the included test patch. Nice surprise: Included a keychain screwdriver (flat head and Phillips) to help fix sunglasses/eyeglasses. A lot cheaper than Oakleys... if he loses them, I won't cry over them."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Fits my mountain bike's crank arm well. Folding ability saves a little bit of vertical space for packing into the car's trunk and also saves some storage in the garage as well. I wish the pedal was a bit wider for more comfortable, efficient riding, but for mountain biking, it is a suitable size."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Fits the Costway/Stakol EP24413/24413-CYPE car freezer perfectly. In testing with my Goal Zero battery inside the house and the same thermostat setting, it drew less power with the insulation than without. The battery went from 100% to 83% with the insulation, and 100% to 76% without over the same time period. The difference should be even more significant during hotter days."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"For years, we had noticed occasional damage here and there to our clothes, especially sweaters. Wife told me it was likely from moths. We did not want to use moth balls as they have health risks associated with them. Finally grabbed some cedar blocks and so far (for the past 4 weeks) we have not discovered any additional damage. Seems to have fixed our moth issue."
Ronny Acosta,"From being on my feet at work for years, it's starting to take a toll on my feet and these heel protectors gave me immediate relief. I didn't think they were going to work that fast but as soon as I put them on and then my shoes, I didn't have that slight pain I usually start off with. The protector itself is fully adjustable so if my feet are a little swollen, I'm still able to wear these without any issues of them being too tight. With that being said, these are very stretchy and comfortable to wear. Even with being on my feet for 10-12 hours at a time, these heel protectors not only continue to work but don't leave those uncomfortable marks either. These can get a little stinky from being worn for so long but these are fully washable. I just let them soak in the sink for a bit and once washed, they can be left out to air dry. I air dry these rather than put them in the dryer. Overall, great quality and love the relief that I get from these."
Ronny Acosta,"From what I counted in my closet, the most items I have in 1 of these bags is between 6-8 cardigans. While they are thin sweaters, I was able to fit that many in just 1 garment bag. In another bag, I was able to fit about 5 of my daughter's dresses and still have room for more in that same bag. The quality of these bags is a lot better than what I thought I was going to be getting. The bags themselves are made of a thick plastic and even with pushing all of these hangers through, they don't tear easily at the opening of the bags. When it comes to zipping these bags up, once they are zipped up, the zipper doesn't move or even start to fall, even with the bags fully loaded with clothes. I have been using and moving these bags around my closet for over a month now and not only are they holding up but they are still in great condition. No tearing or ripping and they are still protecting the clothes that I have inside of these bags."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Good chopping boards are sometimes difficult to find unless you are willing to spend tons of cash. I ordered this set with expectation that it might not last long. So far, I was proven wrong -- it is sturdier than I expected. Let's see how long it will last before it splits."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Got these for my vacation home in the mountains where snow can make the driveway hard to see. I would hate to crash into the shallow brick wall. Lights do not help because they would be covered by snow. So, markers are the solution. They also help us guide the driver on where to go. We sometimes also use them to mark off areas we don't want people to step on when reseeding grass."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Hook up to one of the TV's USB ports, set the color or color cycling modes you want, and it'll stay like that in memory. It lights up when the TV turns on, and powers off when the TV shuts down. App is available to control ambiance with, but I never tried it -- would rather not install due to possible invasion of privacy/data theft. I set the color to a light blue and haven't changed it since. Pieces of the strip can be cut as needed without breaking the entire light. You can also splice them back together with LED strip connectors (not included)."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Hung these up for my parents' sliding doors by the kitchen to block some of the sunlight without obscuring visibility into the backyard. This is so they can enjoy seeing the outdoors still while also keeping an eye out on the grandchildren playing outside. This does NOT block the sun entirely, and so expect some heat to enter the home. It also will not entirely keep you private against spying eyes. You do get some privacy during the daytime, but once the lights inside are turned on at night, somebody outside can see you. Combat that with a bright motion sensing light outside to alert you when somebody's nearby."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I absolutely love Chinese BBQ skewers and the recipe couldn't be simpler:  Marinade cubes of lamb, beef, or chicken in cubed, red onions, oil, and a whole egg (yes, egg!) for 1 hour. Skewer the meats. Sprinkle ground cumin and chili powder (I like Cayenne pepper) over the skewer while cooking over charcoal. Keep turning the skewers until done. Salt as needed to add an additional kick of flavor. Delicious! Works especially well with lamb."
Ronny Acosta,"I already don't have much space in my closet but with these hanger organizers, it creates so much more space. I do suggest that you make sure that before putting hangers in these that you make sure those clothes won't be touching the ground. I noticed that depending on what I was hanging, I did have to either leave the last couple of holes open or I put something different inside. I don't really hang the other side but rather hold it up to see what I want to wear. However, in some areas I am able to hang the other side. These really do come in handy and allow me to have so much more space in my closet that I normally didn't have to. I've been able to use plastic, wire and wooden hangers with these hanger organizers and no matter the type of hanger, I was able to hang them in this hanger organizer. Really does create the space that I never had before."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I always tried to guess how much fuel was remaining by gently shaking around the 16 oz Coleman fuel tanks, but now I have a more accurate way of measuring. Uses two CR2032 coin batteries (included) and attaches to a 14oz or 16oz standard Coleman fuel cylinder. You then lift it up to have it give you an approximate fuel level. The mechanism it uses is most likely based on pre-programmed weight. Push down on the cylinder a bit and suddenly, the tank became ""full"". Yep, pressure-based gauge. Better than shaking the tank around by hand."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I am a fan of Santoku (Japanese, ""Three Virtues"") knives for slicing, dicing, and mincing and have always purchased the Shun brand. I also own a few Wusthof Chef knives, but there is something about Japanese knives that always make me go back to them, because they look so unique and are so fun to cut with. This Konoll does not show the craftsmanship, beauty, balance, and strength of a quality Japanese knife, but for this price, it works well enough. Hopefully, it will last as long as my Shun knives that I had bought over a decade ago and still cut very well. This knife cuts VERY well, the handle provides a good grip, and is decently well-balanced (as all knives should be). Good knife for the lower price."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I am a fan of the Killer Hogs BBQ Rub for all my BBQs -- whether for chicken, ribs, or even salmon. This Casa spice is actually quite delicious, and I do not mind rubbing with it. For one, I appreciate that it is not as salty as many BBQ rubs, and this allows you to season as needed. One of my favorite additions to also add to this rub from time to time is cumin and chili powder, especially when added to shrimp or lamb. Heaven!"

Outdoor Enthusiast,"I am a professional wedding and landscape photographer who used to travel a lot. My business has been put on hold for now while waiting out the COVID-19 pandemic, and I have also already sold one of my cameras. Until I have replaced it with the mirrorless Canon I want (there is a global shortage at this time with high prices), I will not yet be customizing this Pelican to fit my gears exactly. With that said, I will comment on this Vault product and the brand in general. The wedding industry knows very well how tough and protective Pelican cases are. They are well constructed and can take a beating while keeping damaging shock waves and vibrations away from the gear it was designed to protect. One of my assistants once dropped a Pelican down the stairs by accidents before while on assignment, and I watched in horror while it tumbled in slow motion -- as did the wedding guests. I shouted ""Oh Sh*"" in my head, but kept on photographing the client's moment. After all, gear can be replaced, but not a client's once-in-a-lifetime memories. I went over during a break to inspect for any damages and to much delight, EVERYTHING stayed as it was. The Pelican lived up to its reputation. This particular Pelican Vault has enough room to keep several of my lenses, Speedlites, a 5D Mark IV, and a future, Canon mirrorless. All I will have to do is cut the foam to the right dimensions in such a way as to maximize the available space while keeping enough padding between each gear to maintain protection. These cases can be considered expensive for some, but when it comes to protecting very expensive gear while out on assignment, it is like an insurance policy worth its cost. Likewise, you should be aware that thieves also know that Pelicans likely contain valuable items. So, always be sure to keep an eye out on your gear while you are photographing!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I am a retired wedding photographer and have used a lot of props to add a little bit of appeal to a photo that might otherwise be boring or cliched. One prop that always is loved by my clients is confetti cannons. They add a lot of flair and atmosphere to a static image, but they are also such a mess to clean up. Some venues will even forbid their use -- don't even think about using them in forest lands or parks! I do find them to be more environmentally friendly (much more) than balloons. Biodegradable? Yes, they are. But what many people do not realize is HOW LONG it takes for them to decompose. In wind and rain, they usually break down in a few weeks. When mixed in compost, they took 4-6 MONTHS to fully disappear. Leave them in the park and wind would certainly make a mess in that area for weeks or months to come. These cannons usually do not scare people too much when popped, but I have seen dogs or pets freak out. So, if you plan on using these as your client's wedding with pets around -- beware!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I am always hesitant to try dietary supplements from Asian companies, especially those coming from places other than Japan or Korea. Before I ordered this ginseng extract, I asked my Korean friends about the brand, BTGin. They said that it's a well-known, trusted brand in their home country. Good enough for me. Product packaging looks premium as it should for the price it commands of roughly $23/oz -- and it certainly gives off a strong smell the moment it's opened. For those who had been in Asian herbal stores, the odor would feel familiar. A spoon is included, and packaging recommends taking the extract twice a day for increased focus, immunity, and energy. Does it do that for me? Hard to tell. I'm always aware of possible placebo effects. My parents swear by ginseng though. So do my grandparents. Do I feel a bit more focused after taking the doses? I think so. Maybe. I'm not sure. Placebo? Maybe. But ultimately, if you feel good -- placebo or not -- your mental health benefits from it. So, if it makes you feel good and more focused, then why not keep taking it? Ginseng is not known to harm you, but check with your doctor for any professional advice."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I am an avid hiker, camper, and wilderness backpacker, and keep a bug out bag for emergencies. One of the most important items to have in your survival gear is a first aid kit. The more complete your kit is, the more you will be prepared for a larger variety of situations. This kit comes with the usual bandages, gauze pads, and so on. The usual, minimal stuff that you want to have available in the car or backpack. To be even more complete of a kit, I would also add a proper tick removal tool (tweezers could stress the tick and make it regurgitate its stomach content into your blood stream, transferring any disease it may have), thermometer, anti-itch cream, burn-relief cream, aspirin, and other medication. Overall, this is a pretty complete, well-packed kit in a small size. Just make sure you check each item's individual expiration date from time to time so you don't get left out in the cold when the need for medical help arises."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I am an avid hiker, camper, and wilderness backpacker. One of the items I pack with me is a reliable multi-tool kit as part of my bug out bag. However, for casual hiking/camping, I often take less expensive tools with me. None of them have an axe or hammer, however. This tool from a no-name brand comes with an axe (no hammer, though the back of the axe could be used as such) and the usual Swiss Army Knife accessories, and I decided to give it a try. Tool is very versatile and useful, suitable for short-term emergency and casual use. Note the word, ""short-term"". Because this is from a brand I have never heard of, I am hesitant to trust it for long term (ie. months) survival. My survival trust falls with Sog or Leatherman tools."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"I am an avid hiker, camper, and wilderness backpacker/trekker, and I wanted to buy something to help ease some of the city friends into the wilderness, especially the women in my group (and some of my male friends.) So, one of my friends already has a collapsible bag where he can pick up water from the river or lake. We then used to warm it up on our wood stove inside a pot and poured it back into the bag. I then placed one of my motorized camp showers into the bag and used a carabiner to hang its showerhead over a tree branch, and voila, my city friends could now wash their hair with biodegradable soap. With that said, motors and batteries could fail. Enter this foot pump-based shower bag. It is fairly a bit on the heavy side at around 2 lbs and holds a plentiful 3 gallons (12L) of water. The bag is colored black -- and this is significant: you could leave the water inside the bag at the campsite so the sun could warm it up. By the time it was ready to shower towards the evening, you'd have warm water available without having had to previously boil it. It has an area where the water level can be visually checked. You do not need to hang this bag off something high as water is pushed by you building up inside pressure with the foot pump. Be careful, however, not to push too hard as the pump (made of PVC) could potentially rupture/puncture. As pressure wanes, the strength of water coming out lowers too until you push down on the foot pump a few times. That's the downside of not having a motorized pump, but at least it should work every time since there are no moving parts or batteries involved that could fail on you unless the foot pump itself punctures. I can imagine this shower working well after visiting a beach too to get the sand washed off your feet. Of course, I'd jump into the lake first to swim around, but then you will always have some sand or dirt stuck to your legs, requiring you to wipe it off with a towel. But with this camp shower, I could now wash the remaining dirt off. My friends appreciate having a shower available for when we go trek into the wilderness. The only problem I now need to solve is to have a portable stall so they can go shower naked without fear of being seen. Sorry, they'll just have to deal with showering semi naked in the wilderness like nature intended. Or, jump into the lake and have fun with the rest of the group :)"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I am an avid hiker, camper, backpacker, and since last year, heavily active in the overland/boondocking activity. I had owned several, portable showers, including ones you manually pump, battery-operated one, and those you hang for gravity to do its work. All had one thing in common: they did not heat the water. Only one actually provided some warmth because its entire bag was black (you leave it out in the sun to heat up, and by the time night came around, you'd have a hot shower). The other ones would always require you to pre-warm the water via other means.

This portable water heater, on the other hand, is heated with a standard propane tank (one of those green Coleman ones), and the pump is operated by the heater's built-in battery. The battery itself lasted through 3 showers, and we didn't have more persons to test with. The battery is rechargeable via a 12v car cigarette port plug that is found in practically every car, and can also be charged from the AC wall. I have a portable power station (Jackery and Goal Zero) that can provide power for both the 12V DC and AC wall methods. It took a while to heat up the water though -- the first shower was fine (I prefer it a bit cooler anyway), but my wife loves HOT showers, and so we always had her go last when it actually was hot. Water heater looks well-made and should last for some time, though the only worry I have is with the pump. Who knows how long it will last? The shower head itself can be replaced easily. Is it worth the cost? For the casual camper, probably not. But for longer trips -- we are talking about days here -- or for those who cannot go camping because they HAVE to have a shower (or HOT shower), this is definitely worth it. My wife and some friends much more enjoy camping now with this thing, although they are not yet fully keen about showering in a pop-up tent, but I digress. Can't please everyone with everything without spending a fortune."
Ronny Acosta,"I am on the phone almost all day at work and what I love about this headset is how it not only connects to my phone fast but it stays connection without any disruption. The headset itself is really comfortable to wear. The piece that goes onto my ear is really comfortable and doesn't aggravate it like some earbuds do. The headset is fully adjustable too. The mic on this headset is also adjustable but love that I no longer have clients asking me to repeat myself because they cannot hear me. Even the most hard of hearing clients that I talk to are able to hear me clearly. The headset can be used on either side of my head which is really convenient, but more importantly, I no longer have to worry about my neck cramping. This headset allows me to be completely hand free. Not to mention, the battery live on this thing is really long. When I'm on lunch, I will connect it to the charger for the just in case but there have been a few times that I have forgotten and it still lasts me my whole day. Clear sound from either the mic or the ear piece."
Ronny Acosta,"I am seriously kicking myself for not buying something like this sooner. I have a 100 gallon tank and when it comes to cleaning, it seems like it takes up all of my days off in order to get everything clean. However, with this gravel cleaning, it not only makes cleaning my tank so much easier but cuts the time in what now only takes me about 20-30 minutes. The suction on this vacuum is really strong that it will not only pick up the gravel but it will suck out all of the yucky that is on the bottom of the tank that usually requires me to take outside to scrub. There have been a few times that the small pieces of gravel will get sucked into the tubing but the tubing is thick and wide enough that it doesn't clog the tubing. Moving this around my tank is really easy to do and even with all the dirt it picks up, I have not had any issues with the water or the gravel being sucked up. Makes cleaning my take so much easier and faster."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I am very pleased with this umbrella as it is not flimsy. The fabric also covers a wide area also. It is easy to open and close, though as with any umbrella, you have to duck when doing that until it gets past your head. The tilt also works well. I have the freestanding umbrella in a cast iron base with a very heavy slate on one end to keep the wind from knocking it over. With that said, even if you have a heavy table, expect umbrellas to fall over and possibly break a glass top table if left open during very windy conditions! That's how my brother learned long ago when he forgot to close it. I just make it a habit of bringing the umbrella down when not using it or when not at home. Not sure how long the nice color will last before fading."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I backpack/camp/hike a lot and my go-to stove is the Jetboil. However, the canisters are expensive and so I wanted a camping stove that could be used with the popular, cheaper Coleman propane canisters. With a $9 adapter (which this one includes), that was exactly possible. With that said, of course the Jetboil-type isobutane canisters work perfectly well with this stove. Piezo-electric igniter is built-in. Holds large pots securely and low to the ground to minimize chances for accidents. I did not detect any gas leaks. Folds up tight into an orange, plastic cube."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these because my old bottles leaked all over my clothes after just 1 flight. With these containers, not only have they lasted through 4 flights but no leaking at all. Even when putting a few of these in my carry on, I was still able to have these pass through security with no issues. However, once again, no leaking of anything. I've been able to put shampoo, conditioner, body wash and even able to put some body spray in the spray bottles. No matter how much these moved around in my bag, no leaking. Even with my toiletry bag opening inside of my luggage, no leaking anywhere. No matter with water liquids or thick, these bottles do not leak. Best part, they are fully airline approved."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these for a ninja themed birthday party and not only do they work on little kids but adults as well. The bracelets themselves arrived with nothing wrong with them. I did check each and every one of them too, but all had ninjas printed all over them and actually work for kids and adults. If hit really hard, it can hurt a bit but if used normally, they don't hurt at all. I did receive a total of 12, 6 red and 6 black. On the bracelets themselves, each background was clearly printed, not to mention the ninjas were clearly printed on them. None of them had any misprinting on them either. Really easy to use and super fun to use too. Not to mention, even after using these for over a month, they still have the print on them and still work great."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these for my daughters because they love dressing up. What I love about this set is it came with 2 of everything so I didn't really have to worry about them fighting over anything. The quality of the skirts is actually really good. I thought for sure that these were going to be cheap and possibly itchy for them but that was not the case. The fabric is pretty soft and can be washed. We do put this inside of our laundry bag when it comes to cleaning and after throwing these in the washer, they came out clean and had nothing wrong with them. We do allow these to air dry though. Even with all the use and wear these shoes and skirts get, they still haven't torn or had anything happen and we've had these for about a month now. I should also mention that they get worn practically every day too."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these for my kids to make different crafts with them. They all arrived with nothing wrong with them. Didn't even have to worry about them causing splinters either. The wood themselves can either be painted on, stained, use alcohol ink and even resin on them. With a few of them, we were even able to break them and create resin coasters with them. They are a little hard to break, but it can be done if you work hard enough. These can even be cut with any wood cutting tools too. When it comes to painting on them, no prep was really needed to be done. We were even able to use wood and strong crafting glue on these wooden pieces. The only issue we had was using a hot glue gun because it didn't stick too well on the wood. Any other type of glue worked just fine. Great quality pieces and so easy to use for any type of crafting."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these for my work boots to prevent them from getting muddy and wet. Not only to they actually go over the bottom part of my boots, but the completely cover them with some extra coverage on my legs. What I didn't realize when I bought these is they actually have a bottom part that is similar to the bottom of my work boots. They still have a good amount of traction on the bottom to prevent me from slipping and sliding around in the mud. Even with stepping in the mud, these do not come off or even slide around. At first I was thinking I could possibly slip or trip but these fit so snugly on my work boots that the covers don't hardly move at all. When done, I'm able to take these off and rinse them off so I can reuse them the next day. Even when I take these home, I'm able to rinse them again, throw them in my washer and let them air dry. The material is made of some thick fabric that doesn't tear or rip easily. There is a cinch on the top that doesn't hurt or bother me while I'm working either. These really do protect my boots from mud and water."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these for the upcoming winter season and when they arrived, they looked a little small. However, looks are very deceiving. As soon as I put them on, they fit perfectly. I wear a size medium in women's gloves and these were the perfect size for me. Not only did they not slip off or way too tight, but they were tight enough that no matter what I grabbed or even dug in my purse, these gloves allowed me to still be able to get things without them falling off or me not being able to make a fist. They do need a little loosening up and I have been wearing them off and on to help. However, after about month and a half, these are perfect. They really do help keep my hands warm too."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these for the upcoming winter season but found myself wearing them now at work. We've gotten some heavy rains and not only was I able to use these, but they are actually waterproof. While working, I watched the rain just drip off of my gloves and not soak through the fabric. This not only made it easier for me to work but my hands stayed dry throughout the whole time I was outside raining. They gloves themselves are really comfortable to wear. While it did take a few times to stretch them out a bit, they now fit perfectly. The inside of these gloves is really soft but more importantly, they are fully waterproof. If I need to wash them, I just throw them in my washer and let them hang dry."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these for work as we have a couple of different style of grills that we use for BBQ's and cookouts on location. The first is a stand up electric grill. These tools not only work great for the grill but if anything gets stuck, these tools help get it off without breaking up our food. The other type we have is a small indoor grill that even though it has a teflon coating, these tools don't scratch it up. I even went as far as using this on my charcoal grill at home and no matter the type of grill we use these tools on, they still work great. Whether we're using electric or an actual flame, these tools don't warp or become damaged from the heat. Not to mention, really easy to clean too."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these poles so I could hook up my lights from my patio over to my fence and these poles worked perfectly. I was able to put these together by myself too. The spikes when inside of my planters that I have outside without damaging my plants inside of them, but when you look at them, you can hardly even see the stakes that went inside. I did have to push pretty hard to get the stakes in but once they were in, they didn't fall or cause my planters to tip over. I was able to hang my lights from my patio to each planter to help create more light outside. Not to mention, make it look a lot nicer. We recently had a big wind and rain storm and even with all the wind and rain that we got, these did not fall over. I even check the stakes and there seems to be no rusting either. Great set of poles and so easy to use."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these to make the pink ornaments I bought and not only are they perfect but they compliment the pink ones too. We bought our daughter a small white Christmas tree and these were the colors she chose. The ornaments are the perfect size for her tree as the tree itself is only about 3ft tall. The size of ornaments that we purchased were the 1.57"" and then the pink ones are about half that size. They did come with string, however, we just used some regular ornament hooks and they work great with these ornaments. They're really easy to hang and what we love about these ornaments is even while decorating or just with the tree up, if she accidentally drops one on her floor, we don't have to worry about these shattering as they're plastic. The glitter did get a little messy but with some spray glue and leaving them out overnight to dry, no more issues with the glitter. Easy to hang and they don't shatter when dropped."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these to not only wear around the house but use them at work when I'm just sitting at my desk. Not only are they really comfortable but they are true to size. I wear a size 7.5-8 but opted to order the 8/9 because I was afraid the 6-7.5 would be too small. So glad I ordered the 8/9 because they fit perfectly. The bottoms of these are fairly thick and even when walking around, they're so comfortable. I have linoleum floors at my work and have not slipped or slid around once since wearing these. I have wood and tile in my house and same for when I wear these at home. I have even walked around in my breakroom with these and people actually thought these were the real deal. Even when they get dirty, I'm able to easily use a sponge to clean these and wipe them dry. Really comfortable to wear and have a lot of comfortable padding on these."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought these to replace some old tools and found that these work so much better than the store bought ones. When it comes to first cutting into pumpkins, these tools were so much easier, especially when it came to gutting the seeds and everything else inside out. To scoop works so much better than using any other spoon or scoop that came with our Halloween pumpkin carving tools. It not only scooped out the seeds and inside faster but also allowed me to scrape the inside of our pumpkins to ensure they were smooth and clean. When it came to carving out small pieces, these tools are really precise and don't cut too much, especially when I'm trying to cut small pieces out. Great set of tools and really easy to clean. The best part about this set is that they come with a carrying case that makes it really easy to store without losing any of the knives either."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this as a lap blanket for when I work and not only does this blanket completely cover my legs but it really keeps me warm. My office gets extremely cold, even during the fall and winter weather and this not only keeps me warm but doesn't slide off even when I'm moving around. The blanket itself is really soft and found that when I first washed this, it did have some shedding issues which forced me to rewash a lot of my other items that were inside with it. However, after washing and drying that first time, I have not had any shedding issues since that first time. Whether I wash and dry this with clothes or other blankets, there has not been any green fibers on my other items. Ever since I first got this, it has not only been soft but no matter how much this gets cleaned, it is still soft and has no roughness at all. I purchased the smaller size because I was wanting a lap blanket and it's perfect for just that. Will definitely be saving this for possibly a bigger one for my bed. Even with the holes, it still keeps me nice and warm."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this as a prank gift for my kid and when they opened the box, all they saw was this. As soon as they pulled it out, I walked up pulled the money out and put it inside before they even realized what had just happened. While it took my kid almost 2 weeks to finally get this open, we all gave it a shot. This is really fun to play with but more importantly, make a person work for their gift. Before I gave it to them, I did check the whole maze to make sure there were no broken pieces on the inside and made sure everything perfectly aligned. To use, once you open the box, there is a lock that holds the ball in place. Once you move the ball, that is when the fun begins. While we will still occasionally play with it, this puzzle really does make you think and figure out how to solve it."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this because my kid is starting to play drums as school and instead of buying them a drum set, I bought this to help them get started. Not only does this save on space in our home but with the pedals, it's been teaching them not only how to press the pedal but also drum at the same time. This did come with drum sticks that they will actually use instead of their own. Setting this up was really easy to do. We just cleared off their desk but also found that setting up a portable, foldable table was just as easy. The padding on this is fairly thick that it doesn't damage what is underneath the drum pad. What's really nice about this drum pad is that there is a volume control button on this so that for people who are studying or working from home, we are not interrupted by drums. Even when they're hitting the pad on the table, it doesn't make a whole lot of noise either. While it has taken a bit to get used to where everything is, they are sounding a lot better compared to day 1. Helpful and great practice."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this blanket to take to work and not only does it work great, but it's so soft. My office gets extremely cold and I use this as a lap blanket. All I have to do is fold it in half and not only does it keep my legs warm but also my ankles and feet. There have been several times that I will actually wrap myself in this blanket too. I have even taken this home, and have used this while watching movies on the couch or recliner. Perfect blanket for 1 or a few people. I have washed this blanket several times and even thrown it in the dryer. Not only has it not shrunk but the stitching is still in great shape. Not fading or pilling either. Great blanket for really anywhere and really does keep me warm."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this blender because it advertised that it cuts through ice without leaving chunks and it really does. When it comes to making my smoothies, shakes or even really anything, this blender blends, cuts, chops and makes anything nice and smooth when need be. The blender itself doesn't take up as much space as I thought it would but I do leave the base on my counter as I have space for it. The container has legible that helps when it comes to measuring anything. The one thing I was surprised about this blender is how quite it is compared to my old one. While this isn't whisper quite, its still not as loud as my old one. Really easy to clean but do watch the blades because they are really sharp. With everything this blender does, we were actually able to get rid of our food processor because this chops vegetables that we would normally use the food processor for."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this dog bed for our new puppy and while I bought this when he was a little smaller, he is now almost at his full grown size, this bed still fits him. There is still actually more than enough room for him to sleep on this. Even our lab mix is able to sleep on this. While she does hang over a bit, I have caught her a few times sleeping in it. The bed itself was kind of flat when we received it so I put it in the wash and had it on low dry. This did help fluff it out but after a few days it really fully came out. I was afraid this bed was going to shed but that is not the case. The bed is fluffy but has not once shed. I'm also able to use a lint brush and not have to worry about pulling out the fibers. Even after washing it due to a few accidents, this bed still looks great and intact. He loves his bed and doesn't really slide too much on our smooth floor."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this for a spare bedroom that we have and while I didn't put a comforter inside of it, because at the time it was a bit warm still, the cover itself is soft enough to use as a comforter. However, now that it's getting colder, we added a comforter and not only is it all we need because the flat sheet, but it keeps you so warm. When it comes to using without a comforter, it's similar to using a thin comforter which is perfect for when it's warm. As soon as we added one, we no longer needed any other blankets, just a flat sheet. It's almost as if when we added the comforter with this duvet cover, it's feels similar to a weighted comforter but not has heavy which is really nice. Even with laying on the pillows, I thought for sure they were going to bother me but they're so soft that I don't even notice it. Really cozy and keeps us nice and warm."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this for my kid because they weren't quite ready for just the hoverboard alone. Not only have they been up and down the street for what seems hours at a time, but I decided to try this myself. While the description and the instructions state that there is a max weight limit of 220lbs, I myself am way under that so I was able to ride this to ""test"" it out. With the seat and front wheels, everything is fully adjustable and can be easily changed to either fit my height or my kid's. The handles did take me a bit to figure out but I found that you don't need to push them down all of the way in order for this to move forward. They are a little sensitive, but found that slowly moving them does increase the speed at a rate I prefer. There is a max speed of 10 mph, but when going the full 10 mph, it does seem a little faster than what I thought. When turning, I did find that giving yourself enough time to turn really helps but this does turn on a dime. When it comes to connecting the bluetooth speakers to my phone, it almost connects instantly. The speakers themselves have great sound quality and even while going, I'm still able to hear my music and traffic. Overall, this really is a lot of fun and feel as though it's a lot safer than just riding the hoverboard by itself."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this for my kid who is a big football fan and player and not only does it work great in his room, but it's also a great night light. The football part of this light arrived with a plastic covering on the front and back which made sure that it would arrive with no damage. To use, all we did was remove the plastic and then insert it inside of the base. This does have the option of using either 3 AAA batteries but does come with a USB cord that works with any USB plug. We ended up buying a longer cord because of where he wanted it placed but even that cord works just as great. To turn on, we just push the button on the base and from there we're able to change the color of the lights too. Great for any fan and can be used for decoration or a night light."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this for my long haired cat and not only does it cut through the mats but keeps her coat tangled free. She normally doesn't like being brushed but with this on, the brush bristles are not too long that they scratch her which is what she doesn't like. While the bristles don't touch her skin, they go through her fur and really brush anything and everything out. Her fur gets tangled up really fast which cause a lot of mat. With this brush, we don't have that issue. When it first came in, we started using it immediately and this is the first time she didn't try to run. When it come to cleaning this brush, we just push a button and her fur just comes up. Even when it comes to pulling it up, all of it comes off and doesn't cause a bunch of loose fur to go everywhere. The handle has a really good grip which makes it really comfortable to hold, especially when it takes awhile to brush her. Gets all tangles and mats out without the mess. Great quality brush."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this for my RV toilet but decided to test this out on my toilets inside of my house. Not only does it clean so much better but it perfectly fits up underneath in the smaller crevice that I have a problem cleaning. I didn't think this was going to clean my toilet because of it's size but don't let the size fool you. It not only cleans the toilets in my house with no issues but when it comes to cleaning my toilet in my RV, it does a great job. The toilet in my RV is a little smaller than the ones in my home and this brush fits so much better than the last toilet brush I bought. Not to mention, when it comes to cleaning, it really gives it a thorough cleaning. Cleaning the brush is really easy to do too. The holder for the brush not only keeps it in place but when it comes to water, it all collects at the bottom tray."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this for my youngest and found that when they leave this laying around I'll actually start to use it. First off, the size of this has helped with keeping them occupied for a very long time. Normally my child has really bad fidgeting problems with going to the doctors and especially when they have to get routine checkups or shots but with this bubble toy, it's so big enough that they're not paying attention to being there but with the bubbles. The toy itself is very durable. Even with everywhere this toy gets taken, it has yet to show any signs of wearing or tearing. If it does get dirty, I love how all I have to do is light scrub this with a sponge. I have only hand washed this and not put this in my dishwasher. It is really easy to wash and dry to. Great quality material and keeps them occupied for hours."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this for myself and my coworkers for the office and while I didn't think it would get used much, it's used a lot. The machine itself is a lot smaller than what I have at home but is perfect for the area that we have it in. Our office is a decent sized but when it comes to space, we don't have a lot of space for a regular coffee maker, but this espresso machine fits perfectly. When it comes to using, the instructions were really easy to follow. Not to mention, we have not experienced any water or coffee leaking out. Filling this is really easy, you just need to make sure you lightly press the coffee grounds and not press too hard as some might fall out. Cleaning this is really easy to do but I suggest waiting until everything has cooled down. This makes a total of 4 cups at a time and depending on the size of mug you use, it could only fill 2 mugs. The milk frother really does work but again, do be careful as the steam that comes out is really hot. After using, if you need to refill the water, I do suggest that you twist the lid enough that it allows some of the steam to come out before fully opening it all of the way. Really does make some strong coffee and espressos."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this for our big game room and not only is it great but the air is just so much cleaner. Normally it can get a little smelly, not to mention it can get very stuffy too. With this humidifier, we do use filtered water for this and not only is the air not stuffy but it feels a lot cooler since using this. Even with the colder weather, this room can still get very stuffy. This humidifier hardly makes any noise while running and not to mention, it doesn't leak. When it comes to using, we're able to set how high or low we want this to run but also able to set it on a timer. Recently we used this in our bedroom and chose the night setting. While I am a very light sleeper, I slept right through this without being woken up. Again, the air smelled fresher but even a little cooler. So easy to use and for the size of this, it really works great for any size room in our house, even our biggest one."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this for work to do quick prints for name badges and for other things and not only does this work great, but when in a hurry, it definitely comes in handy. What I love about this is it will connect to either iPhones or Androids with ease. The app is really easy to use and allows me to not only to change the text of the letters but I'm also able to add pictures if I want to. While I did go through the sticker paper really fast, I was able to buy these locally. The print quality is surprisingly clear. I wasn't sure what kind of print quality I was going to get with this but even when it comes to printing pictures, the pictures are completely clear and have not blank spots in them. Great for adult and kid use but really does come in handy for me."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this in hopes it would help prevent sweat getting in my mask and me having to constantly change it. Not only does it work but I use less masks because of this fan. While there are times I have to run around, this mask fan not only helps my face dry inside of the mask but feels as though I'm getting fresh air without sounding winded all of the time. The fan itself clips onto all sorts of masks that I've had to wear. I've used this with fabric, surgical, KN95 and N95 masks. Not only does this fan stay clipped on but it has not pulled my mask down. The fan itself is fully rechargeable and on a single charge, I've been able to use it for at least 2-3 days before having to charge it again. There have been a few times I was able to go 4-5 days without charging it but it does depend on how much use it gets. Really does come in hand and not only helps keep my face from sweating too much but really helps with giving me that ""fresh air"" feeling."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I bought this primarily for use as a protective, insulated carry case for the Goal Zero Yeti 500x (equivalent as the Yeti 400). It fits the battery power station PERFECTLY. Insulation looks good, material feels great (except the shoulder strap). Folds very compact."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this so I could have a hot meal at lunch since our work microwave is disgusting, plus it always smells weird. I bought this so I wouldn't have to worry about rushing home to enjoy a hot or warm meal. Not only has this been great but it actually works. So you're given 2 choices when it comes to using this lunch box. One, you can either plug this into your car which makes it great when you're out somewhere and cannot find a plug or use when camping. The other way is plugging it into an outlet. Since I use this at work, I primarily plug this into an outlet and found that it warms up my food a lot faster than when I use it in my car. What I love about this is, unlike when I microwave my food, my food doesn't come out dried out or tough. I get a fully warmed up meal that tastes as if I reheated it in the oven. Depending on what I have, is what determines how long I have this plugged in. If I want to reheat a piece of chicken breast, if its not cut, it will take longer to reheat when the breast is cut into pieces. Pastas never seem to take long either. When it comes to cleaning, the dishes are dishwasher safe too. The lunch box itself, I just wipe down. The utensils are definitely a bonus and are dishwasher safe too."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this to hang on a tree near my garden and I absolutely love how it looks. I am keeping it out there until winter gets here but when the sun hits it, the colors just look so vibrant. Not to mention, with the wind or breeze that we've been getting, it spins around and just looks mesmerizing. When it arrived, it came as a flat disc. All I had to do was spread it out and hang it up. While this did come with a hook, where I have it hanging, the hook was not big enough to fit around the branch. However, I was able to hang this with some heavy wire and it works just as great. This looks way better in person than it does online and when it spins, is really does look great. Even with the heavy wind storm that we had recently, I thought for sure it was going to either fly away or break. However, when I checked on it, this was still hanging on my tree just spinning away. I found that I am able to easily clean it since the wind storm caused this to get really dirty. All I do is just hand wash it with a little dish soap and water and just hang it back outside to dry. Absolutely love how this looks and even tested this on my patio and looks great there too."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this to help replace some old knives and to use in my trailer. Not only are they perfect and actually fit in my knife block but they are sharp. The knives themselves have a really comfortable grip on them and really do fit inside of my hand. The bigger knife seems to cut through any time of meat as if it was butter. I have not had any issues cutting through some of the toughest meat or felt as though I was sawing through it. The next knife cuts through meat too but found that with the divots, it also helps when it comes to cutting through more solids like cold butter, bricks of cheese and a lot of fruits and vegetables. The smaller knife really has come in handy for practically anything. Overall, great filler for replacing old knives. Super sharp and really easy to hold."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this to help some of my smaller/baby plants that were starting to die due to the cold, lack of sun and really because I don't have time to take care of them like I could. With this growing kit, I not only was able to bring one of my plants back to life, but I was able to transfer it from this growing system to an actual pot and leave it outside. This growing kit comes with everything to help keep them fed, but the extra vitamins to help nourish them and help them grow bigger. While I still have 2 plants in this, setting this up was really easy to do. The instructions were really clear, but I have used one of these previously so I had an idea of what I was doing. What I love is that I don't have to have this in a certain amount of light because this has a light that is not only the perfect temperature but doesn't damage the leaves. The light is fully adjustable and the top can be lifted higher or lower if need be. No leaking and such a great setup, especially if you're like me and don't have a lot of time to take care of my plants."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this to help with all of the baking I am having to do but with my old mixer dying on me, this was really put to the test. Not only did have to have bake all sorts of breads and desserts but I was even able to have this help me make some tamales and even some dips. What I love about this mixer is it's so much bigger than my name brand mixer. Not to mention, it mixes a lot faster and is so much more sturdier. The bonus for me was not only did it come with extra attachments but the cover on this prevented anything from splashing out from the top. Since getting this, I have been using it nonstop practically and not only is it getting the jobs done, but it's holding up a lot better than my old mixer. I've been making all sorts of dough, crusts, pie fillings, homemade whipped toppings and even was able to try and make marshmallows. So easy to use and it's easy to clean too. This has definitely replaced all of my mixers, stand and hand."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this to not only use inside but mainly to use when I'm cooking on my flat top grill. Not only does it work great but there is so much space inside. I included a video and some pictures of what it looks like on my flat top. I have a 3 burner flat top and this doesn't take up too much space, roughly about half depending on which burner or burners I'm using. When it comes to using, before I cover my food, I squirt a little water underneath and cover it with this dome. While I can see a little steam come out from underneath, majority of it stays inside of the dome and melts the cheese perfectly. The handle on this is really convenient as it completely covers any metal exposed and while it can get warm, it's not too hot that it burns when I grab it bare handed. When it comes to cleaning, just hand wash this and done. Really works great on my flat top and even on my pans I use on my stove inside of my house. I even used this on my griddle for in home and during camping and works great on that too."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this to replace an expensive name brand that would not only create a bigger mess than I would like but didn't work like it used to. I spent a lot of money to have someone take it apart and clean the parts on the inside but even then, it still didn't work that great. I bought this and not only is it so much easier to use but when I tilt the head of this mixer, I'm actually able to remove the bowl without the top being in the way. The lid on this that covers the mixing bowl really does prevent any mess from coming out from the top. Whether I'm mixing in wet ingredients into dry or vice versa, whether I have this mixer on low or high there is no mess. Usually I have a big mess when making homemade whip cream but no more mess. The bottom of this mixer actually has suction cups that stick to my counters and prevents this mixer from moving around, especially when I have this on a higher setting. The other thing I love about this mixer is it came with 3 different attachments and was really convenient. The bowl on this mixer is more than big enough to mix or make whatever I want. Since the holidays are getting closer, I've been using this a lot more lately and I love this mixer. Can make practically anything without causing a mess or worrying about this mixer tipping over or moving when on high. The bowl and attachments are dishwasher safe too."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this to replace an old chair at work that had absolutely no lumbar support and was so hard to adjust. Not to mention, would fall after sitting down for at least 5-10 minutes. While I was very hesitant about this chair, after putting it together, I tested it out. After sitting down for about 15 minutes, it never once fell. I then decided to use the leg rest and not only is it really comfortable, I have found that it's makes a great way to take a nap during a break. The lumbar support in this chair is not only great for my back, but provides just enough support that while I'm sitting down, I'm not having to constantly stretch my back. Not to mention, even when I completely recline this chair, it still offers me the great lumbar support as it does while I'm sitting down. Putting it together was a bit of a pain, but I'm working in kind of a small work space so that was my issue. The instructions it came with were really easy to follow and even though I had a couple of screws left over, I had no missing parts. Even while I recline, I don't find myself feeling as though I'm going to fall completely backwards. Really comfortable chair and great all over support. Not to mention, easy to adjust too."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this to replace what I thought was a good projector but when compared to this one, that one is just basic. The picture quality on this projector is not only crystal clear but there are no grainy pictures. Whether we play this on an actual projector screen or a sheet, the picture quality is almost as if we were watching our expensive 4K TV. Setting this up was easy but with this one, it actually connects to our phones and speakers. When connecting this to play what is on our phone, tablets or really any other device, we can either connect this directly to our devices or we connect the projector to our wifi which then allows us to steam shows and movies as if we were watching our smart TV. This does come with a case to keep this projector safe and protected. Great for at home, family get togethers or even while out camping. Completely portable but does require an outlet but can say that we used a portable powerbank that has outlets and we were able to use this projector on it."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this to use as a travel sleeping mask and when this advertises that it blocks out the light, it really does block out the light. The cutouts on this mask really help prevent the mask from putting any pressure on my eyeballs themselves. The strap that goes behind my head is fully adjustable and no matter how much I move around, it doesn't adjust or slip off of my head. The mask itself is really comfortable to wear too. I wasn't sure if the cutouts were going to bother me but they are not only comfortable but that is what helps prevent any sort of light from coming in. Even if I open my eyes with the mask on, I'm able to actually do that and I see no lights at all. Easy to wash and hang dry."
Ronny Acosta,"I bought this with intentions of saving this for Christmas but as soon as it arrived, I wanted to test this out. Not only is it a lot of fun, but I ended up giving it to my kid early because it was so easy and fun to use. My kid is 6 and is obsessed with dinosaurs. When it came to showing them how to use it, they kind of figured it out on their own. This is mainly in part of the remote that it comes with. Instead of just blank buttons, each button is labeled with everything it does. The dinosaur scream really does sound like a dinosaur scream/roar rather than a squeak or something that is supposed to sound like a dinosaur. The movements and tail moving is what we thought was really cool. We have tile and wood floors but have a few low rugs in our living area and it was able to walk from floor to rug and back to the floor without tipping over. The remote control does require 2 AAA batteries that it did not come with but we got this last month and it still has the same batteries I put in the remote the first day. Charging this dinosaur does take between 3-4 hours and it does last between 45 minutes to about just over an hour of play time but this does depend on how much play it gets at a time. Overall, great toy and so much fun to play with."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I cut these to close up the holes in the attic after a bird decided to start building a nest under the roof. Used regular scissors to cut these to size (2"" larger than the opening on all sides) and then secured with a staple gun. Be careful though: they are pretty sharp."
Ronny Acosta,"I didn't think these were going to taste that great as I've purchased something similar and they tasted horrible. However, these taste similar to the peach ring candies, but are not as sugary. I bought these for me as I take enough pills, I thought I'd try gummies and these are great. My magnesium levels were a bit low and after taking these for about a month, I went back and just did my blood work. My results were just sent to me today and not only did they increase but they're back to normal levels. I have also added a healthier diet. The other thing I'm impressed with these gummies is that they don't upset my stomach unlike some vitamins will. I can get back acid reflux if I take too many vitamins and since taking these, no upset stomach or acid indigestion. I do keep these in an area that doesn't get humid or too warm and found that they don't stick to each other either. Great taste and don't hurt my stomach."
Ronny Acosta,"I didn't think this was going to fit inside of my CD slot but it did. I then was afraid that it was going to come out or fall out as soon as I put my phone in the holder or even fall when I hit a bump. This has not happened for either one. Now that the weather has gotten cooler, I was then able to switch out the backing and put this on my vent. The clip on this is very strong on my vent too. Even after putting my in the holder, it doesn't cause my vent to close. No matter how many bumps I hit or speed bumps, my phone stays in the phone holder. Even with my new battery case that can cause my phone to be a little extra bulky, my phone still stays locked into this phone holder. Strong hold with or without a case. Not to mention, the opening on the bottom still allows me to charge my phone still."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I do a lot of DIY work, and cutting through drywall is (unfortunately) something I have to do often. Whether fixing plumbing, adding and rerouting electricals or network cables, or what not -- drywall is everywhere. Cutting into drywall is easy, but having it done nicely can help patching it up later much easier. That's where these drywall blades come in with their pointed tip for easier penetration, then cut through. I usually only cut at a 45-degree, inward angle along 3 of the 4 sides. This allows me to lift up the remaining, attached side (like an Advent calendar) to do work, then I can simply close the drywall and patch up with just a couple screws. The blade itself is quite sharp and feels hefty. Its grip feels decent and it balances well in my hand. At $10, it's a good buy."
Ronny Acosta,"I don't have a lot of space in my garage for my outdoor pantry, but this shelf not only fits but is the perfect size. Prior to ordering, I did check the measurements and it fits perfectly in the open space that I have. When it came to installing, the instructions were really clear on how to put this together. The bottom feet are fully adjustable which is great because where I have it, the concrete is not completely level. However, with being able to put a couple of the feet out a little more than the others, this helps keep the shelf completely steady and it doesn't move at all. Even when I was putting stuff on it and adjusting things, this shelf did not move or wobble anytime I touched it. Since it is wired, I was able to put S hooks on this and even hang things on the sides of this shelf. I have things like boxes of pasta and even heavier items on the bottom like extra bottles of detergent. No matter if the items are light or heavy, this shelf holds it all. No bending or wires popping off from their welds either. Perfectly sturdy and holds so much stuff."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I felt really bad for the seller. First, customer service was excellent. With that said, here is what happened: First order arrived with lid having come off. Content was all over the bubble mailer. I contacted the seller and he promptly shipped me a replacement that arrived in 2 days. Second order arrived with lid loose. Liquid had spilled out, but the content was still intact. Since my wife did not trust opened containers due to concerns for food poisoning, I contacted the seller again. He promptly shipped another replacement that arrive din 2 days. Third jar finally arrived in great condition. Note that all 3 shipments were handled by Amazon. I gave the seller two suggestions: ask Amazon to ship in different packaging or find a better way to secure your own product, such as taping the lid shut. Taste-wise, there is not much truffle mixed in. I expected that considering the price of the product. But, it does taste pretty good. I added it to some steamed meat dishes and it tasted just like the truffle version we had at a Chinese restaurant. Does it taste as good as pure truffle? Of course not, but it's a decent enough taste. Good seller customer service, but poor shipping/packaging."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I felt really bad for the seller. First, customer service was excellent. With that said, here is what happened: First order arrived with lid having come off. Content was all over the bubble mailer. I contacted the seller and he promptly shipped me a replacement that arrived in 2 days. Second order arrived with lid loose. Liquid had spilled out, but the content was still intact. Since my wife did not trust opened containers due to concerns for food poisoning, I contacted the seller again. He promptly shipped another replacement that arrive din 2 days. Third jar finally arrived in great condition. Note that all 3 shipments were handled by Amazon. I gave the seller two suggestions: ask Amazon to ship in different packaging or find a better way to secure your own product, such as taping the lid shut. Taste-wise, there is not much truffle mixed in. I expected that considering the price of the product. But, it does taste pretty good.

Of course not, but it's a decent enough taste. Good seller customer service, but poor shipping/packaging."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I got myself this set as a spare for our vacation home so I would not have to haul my Makita over for any repairs. It is small. Has a built-in light. Torque is pretty good, but nearly not as strong as my much-pricier Makita. A variety of drill bits are included as well as a flexible adapter to allow you creatively bend and screw things in or out. A generously sized bag is also included.It is small. Has a built-in light. Battery is small and I won't expect for it to last for larger jobs, but it works. Battery must be removed for charging. At less than $50, this tool does present itself with great value."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I got this as a backup fin for my inflatable stand up paddle boards (iSUP). Its 9"" size is what came with the iSUPs. Tested it on 3 different brands: DvSport, Runwave, and Abysup. They all fit."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I got this to power up two, 12V cigarette port appliances while out camping. Previously, I used a 12V and a 110V AC one, but as you may or may not know, using the AC one will waste an additional 7W of energy that the DC-to-AC inverter requires. So, using two 12V DCs is more efficient use of the battery. This worked well with my Jackery, Rockpals, and GoalZero power stations and powered a few car freezers Foho, Costway, and Donmende."
Ronny Acosta,"I got tired of using boxes and whatever else I could find to rest my feet on and decided to buy a foot rest. What I love about this one is it's so easy to adjust. In the back, I'm able to adjust the height and unlike my old one, it stays at the height I want it to. If I take my shoes off, there are the beads in the middle that give me a little massage when I move my foot up and down on them. I didn't think it would make a difference but they actually do. The other thing I love about this foot rest is that it moves back and forth so I'm still able to get some motion in my legs while I'm sitting at my desk. Since using this, I'm noticing that I'm not having as many back problems as I was before when I would sit for long periods at my desk. Really easy to setup and such a life saver for my back, legs and feet."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I grew some in a greenhouse in California to see how they would be like. It actually is too late in the season to start, but I was curious for the sake of having something to try before writing up a review. I got about an 80% germination rate with just a few seeds placed into soil that kept at about 84F. After the usual growing time (2-3 months), I tasted the Black Krim variety that was VERY delicious. The California sun did it well! The Cherry ones grew well, too, but did not produce much. I look forward to growing the rest of the seeds come Spring next year. Fun fact: not all varieties will grow well. So, this variety pack will help you figure out which ones work best for your area so you can buy more of those."
Ronny Acosta,"I had an existing fixture in our guest room and I wanted something relaxing and almost beachy looking to go along with my decorations and this light is perfect. When it came to installing, everything that came with this light was enough for me to change out the light. The light itself allowed me to use any light bulb that I want to use. The cover on this is made of thick rattan and found that when it came to cleaning, I just use a dry duster. In the instructions it did state not to keep in humid or high light areas and luckily in my guest room, I don't have any of those. I have now had this light up for almost 2 months and it still looks new. Love the relaxing look of this light and love how easy it was to install."
Ronny Acosta,"I had been looking for a simple pine garland to replace some old stuff on my wreath and this is perfect. The garland itself is really easy to use and bends to any shape or way I wanted. What I love is that the pine cones and berries that are attached do not break or fall off easily. Even with using a hot glue gun to hold them in place, they're still attached and didn't fall as soon as the hot glue came into contact with the stems. The lights on this garland really do add that extra something that I was wanting on my wreath. The lights are battery powered but once they're on, they don't kill batteries that fast. Even with using a hot glue gun on the plastic that houses the batteries, the case is very heavy duty and didn't melt. I can definitely see ordering this again if I need more decoration on my fire mantle but as for now, it looks great on my wreath. The best part is that none of the pine needles shed or break off if they're touched. Really easy to manipulate and move around without anything breaking or the garland itself falling apart."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I had been trying to get my 5-year-old son to learn to swim, and for a while he seemed to make good progress until a few months before COVID-19 hit. He suddenly freaked out about going to swimming lessons and he reverted to not wanting to try. Since then, I had him join me on stand up paddle boarding outings every weekend or so since last year, and to my surprise, he had been watching me teach others how to paddle. He warmed up to my encouragements to try paddling himself and he did very well. But... He still refused to jump into the water. And he was cold after each trip. Got him this wetsuit. I did not want to give him a full-bodied one as in California, it rarely is needed for most of the year. Kept him warm, and he was finally ready to get into the water and he LOVED it. Excellent! He had been swimming in the bay with his life vest, paddled on my iSUP for the last two weekends (with a rope I had tied to it so he could be pulled back when he went too far). This wet suit (or any brand, most likely) gave my son the courage and joy to go swim, and hopefully, that will continue translating into having him want to learn to take swim lessons again. Next step: having him be more willing to submerge his head in the water. He still refuses usually, but when I tell him that he won't be able to go iSUP with me again if he doesn't practice it, he tries it for a couple seconds. Baby steps."

Ronny Acosta,"I had done research on alarm clocks that turn on a light and also does make noise and found that this not only slowly wakes me up but doesn't scare me like my other alarm does. Since getting this alarm, I've hit snooze less and less when compared to my other alarm that I have. The light on this starts off low and then increasingly gets brighter. The other thing I love about this alarm is it also plays the radio. It has a lot of different features but rather than making a noise when waking me up, I can either have it with a light or not, wake up to an alarm noise or the radio. Not to mention, I can also use this as a night light if I want to. Thought I was getting a simple alarm but found I got so much more."
Ronny Acosta,"I had previously purchased a light up gnome and wanted another one to go next to it. While the other one does have lights, it's not as bright as this one. Not to mention, the light on this gives off a pretty blue hue that not only adds color to my small walkway garden but actually lights up the area so much better than my other one. What I love about this garden gnome is I don't need to have this plugged in or worry about batteries as its all rechargeable by a solar panel. The gnome is just the perfect size for my small walkway garden that I have near my front door. Even with the sprinklers that I have nearby, this gnome does get wet a good amount of times but this gnome still lights up every night. The other great thing about this gnome is even with being in the sun, the paint on this still has not faded."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I had previously reviewed Campingmoon's foldable fire pit and grill and was impressed by its quality compared to 2 other ones I had tested. What impressed me was the material and build quality thinking that it came from a Chinese brand -- and as many of you perhaps know, China has the stigma of producing subpar products. Not Campingmoon. The fire pit manual came in both Chinese and Japanese, and so I thought it might actually be a Japanese brand. Japan is, in contrast to China, known for quality. Turns out, Campingmoon actually is a Chinese company with products sold in the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean markets. I also saw that there was an increasing following in Thailand, and as you can see with this product on Amazon, it also appears to try to make inroads into the US market. So, how does this grill table fare? Not surprisingly, very well! Material is sturdy, strong, and looks like it could last. It is not flimsy at all. Legs fold and the grills are vertically stackable, though you should do that BEFORE you put them into the fire. With some additional oil seasoning, food did not stick if you control the cooking temperature properly, and I appreciated the fact that they each can also be used as side tables while cooking. For instance, I could start cutting up veggies and prepare meats, then simply place the grill over my fire pit and be ready to let it sizzle. When done, I simply fished it back out with heatproof gloves and ate right from it, though I suggest you remove the cooked food and wipe down the grill while it is still warm/semi-hot so food would come off easier for less cleaning. The spaced side rails allow for utensils and cookware to be hung off. Nice touch. I also use one of the grills over my propane fire pit to prop up a kettle or pot to boil or heat up over the fire. The grills fold up flat and fit into the sturdy carry bag. I do place the cooled grills into a plastic bag first so to keep dirt away from the carry bag. Nicely done, Campingmoon."
Ronny Acosta,"I had purchase the name brand of these and they were absolutely awful. We had some balloons that didn't even inflate and some that exploded as soon as they dropped into a pool full of water. With these balloons, not only do you get so much more but they actually work. We installed each piece onto our water hose. We didn't turn it up high but just enough to fill the balloons fairly fast. Again, we had a small inflatable pool full of water and once the balloons were full, they practically dropped on their own. Once they hit the water, not only did they not explode but they kept their size with no issues. Once we were done filling all of these, really fast, we had so much fun. The quality of the balloons were so much better and once they hit the grass, concrete or a person, that is when they exploded. While there was a small balloon mess afterwards, these are so much easier to do rather than doing balloons by hand. Not only do they fill up fast but once their full, they will drop on their own. If now, after a small jerk of the hose, they dropped off the stem. These are so much fun and definitely will be ordering these again when the weather is warmer."
Ronny Acosta,"I had purchased another lash wash that not only burned my eyelids but ended up leaving my eyes, eyelids and even underneath red for a few days afterwards. With this wash, I did not experience that at all. Not to mention, while it has a nice clean scent, it doesn't have an overly perfume smell to it. It not only cleans my lash extensions gently, but it doesn't tear them out when I scrub them with the wash brush during cleaning. The wand that this comes with not only helps me with separating them, but helps me brush them out so the look more natural. I don't need a lot of this wash during and while I do clean them every 1-2 days, I still have some of this wash still."
Ronny Acosta,"I had purchased something similar to this and it didn't really spin. However, this one really does spin. Whether empty or really full, this thing will spin no matter what. I originally purchased this set for makeup but turns out it works extremely better for my seasonings that I use all of the time. I have this in a cabinet but found when I'm cooking, I can easily pull this out and move this around to get what I need. Even if I don't pull it out, I'm able to spin it around and grab what I want. What I love about this is that no matter what I put on this, nothing spills out while I'm spinning this around. Not to mention, it hardly takes up any space inside of my cabinet. The other cool thing is that it does come with dividers but if you don't want to use them, you don't have to install them. I chose not to but I was able to keep them for the just in case. Plus if something spills, I'm able to hand wash these with no problems."
Ronny Acosta,"I had seen a similar mask on social media and thought it would be perfect for Halloween. Not only is it surprisingly comfortable to wear but it is really cool. I thought I was going to have issues seeing out of this, especially while it's on but I have not had any issues with it at all. Even with the lights going on, it doesn't effect being able to see through this mask and I was able to walk around without tripping on anything. The remote that comes with this is really easy to use and love that it's a wristband that can be worn. Found that this makes it easier when it comes to changing the different faces. The mask is fully adjustable and can be worn by kids or adults. I did include a video of some of the faces that this mask makes. Really a lot of fun to wear and was even able to test this out and scare some family members."
Ronny Acosta,"I have 2 little ones who love unicorns, but even with just having the 1, they share this between each other. However, I am getting ready to order another one after posting this. This headlamp is fully adjustable no matter the head size. I was even able to adjust this and wear this on my head with no issues. To turn this on, just push the ""horn"" of the unicorn. As soon as you push it once, it turns on to a solid bright white light that comes out through the eyeballs. If you press it again, the lights are still white but now flashing. If pressed for a third time, the lights still flash but they're multi colored. When pressed for the fourth time, the lights completely turn off. My kids did wish that these would be a solid multi-color but they still like the light. This does take batteries and while we have had to change them once, we use rechargeable batteries that seem to work with this headlamp. You can choose to either have music or sounds with this or turn it off. Can be used for toddlers, kids, teenagers and adults."
Ronny Acosta,"I have a case on my phone and I was able to use this ring on it without it causing any issues with being on my case or with the ring itself. I did have to thoroughly clean my case before placing this on and once it's stuck on there, it's stuck. What I love about this ring is that if I lift it once, I'm able to hold my phone. I'm also able to have this stand up on it's own. Even with the weight of my phone, it does not start to fall or even slowly start to close. Even when it's all the way open and standing, again with the weight of my phone, this stand will not close or slowly start to fall. Even with this being as stiff as it is, even after using since I've gotten this almost 2 months ago, it is still holding my phone up. Doesn't seem to add any weight to my phone and doesn't get in the way when I'm using my phone either. Whether you use this on your phone directly or on a case, this ring really does help."
Ronny Acosta,"I have a chihuahua and a pug that both bite and fight when it comes to cutting their nails and trimming the fur in between their toes. However with this hammock, I no longer have to get a towel or blanket and fight with them. The only issue I had was finding somewhere to hang this but luckily we have a swing set that has a pole wide enough that this fits on. Once inside, they are limited to how much they can move. While they can still kind of move their paws, I'm still able to sit down and trim each one without having to break a sweat. The S hooks that this came with work for our small chihuahua but we ended up buying thicker ones for our pug as he's a little heavier. This can collect fur, especially if we cut their nails before a bath, but we found that we can either clean it out with a lint roller or just throw it in the washer. At first I thought this was going to hurt either one of them but it really doesn't. Makes it so much easier and less fighting when it comes to trimming which means less risk of hurting them accidentally."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have a device that allows you to copy one hard drive to another, accommodating both 2.5"" and 3.5"" drives. They are bulky, but can be used to clone drives without the need for a computer. 
This one here is much more portable, though it can only be used to read from or write to one drive. You need to hook it up to a computer to be able to read or write a drive. It's an inexpensive accessory. No driver installation was needed with both Windows 10 and OS X. Performance was within USB 3.0 parameters and achieved pretty good performance -- if your computer, OS, firmware, and driver support UASP. UASP is built into Windows 10."
Ronny Acosta,"I have a few pairs of Crocs and then some clogs that look like Crocs but have similar holes on the tops and these fit with no issues with the Crocs and non-Croc shoes. This set did come with 2 bracelets that I gave to my kids so they could use the charms on their bracelets but we were able to use these on all of our Crocs and non-Crocs. The tabs on the back can be easily inserted into the holes of the shoes and when they need to be or if we want to change them, we just push them out with no issues. When it comes to using these on the bracelets, we just pull one side and we can pop them out with no problems. We recently even purchased the Croc flip flops and we were even able to use these shoe charms on the sandals. Even if they get dirty, we just put them in the sink and just hand wash them. Once dried, we just put them back on our shoes. Great quality and they don't come off easily either."
Ronny Acosta,"I have a kid who loves taking and putting things back together, not to mention loves any sort of STEM type of toys and these dinosaurs are just perfect. For one, my kid loves dinosaurs and especially dinosaur toys. But more, they love STEM toys that allows them to put things together and take them apart. The great thing about these dinosaur toys is no matter how much they pull them apart and put them back together again, they have not warn down at all. Not to mention, the tabs that are on the inside of these toys have not broken off or do they break off easily. The quality of the material and paint on these is a lot better than most toys I've purchased. They are even safe when it comes to bath time."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have a large hand pump that does not fit into my backpack when out biking, but I hate bringing those smaller hand pumps that attach to the bike. They take forever to pump. This foot pump strikes a good compromise -- inflates VERY quickly (because of its 2 cylinders) and is small enough to pack away. The nozzle attachments are attached to keep them from getting lost easily. Pressure matched with another gauge. So, it's reasonably accurate."
Ronny Acosta,"I have a Lenovo laptop that is about 14 inches and this fits perfectly. There is an extra attachment that actually hooks onto the back of my screen and when it's on, it does not move. Once I plug the screen into my laptop, it will automatically connect itself, especially once it's powered on. Having this extra screen really allows me to simply drag any window or other things that I normally have to minimize onto the other screen. The cord that connects the screen to my laptop is always secure as soon as it plugs in and even when I'm inserting a flashdrive and I accidentally touch it, the cord does not really move or cause the screen to glitch. The screen is just as bright and vibrant as my laptop. Rather than having a whole monitor, laptop or connecting this to an actual monitor, this screen is completely portable and convenient. Once done, it folds up and fits inside of my laptop bag. Really helps when I need that extra screen space."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have a Mr. Heater Buddy indoor heater for camping. Issue with it is that the heat doesn't distribute evenly across the tent, and so a fan helps. BUT, there's an issue with a fan: it needs a battery. Best option? Thermal fan. Attach that to the top of the Mr. Heater Buddy and let the thermal heat power the fan with no battery required! I got this to work by using a Dremel to cut a notch into the base and having it then attach to the Mr. Heater's protective, metal grille. Be sure to not place the fan too close to the heat source or you could melt away parts. You'll have to test how far back and how high to place the fan over the Mr. Heater."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have a similar water pump sprayer made by Futone -- same size, nearly the same design, and usability. It does not have a pressure relief valve, however. A relief valve can help take out the pressure so the sprayer can be stored away more effortlessly and without having to worry about pressure getting so high, that components or the bottle itself would explode or fail. On the other hand, not having a relief valve also helps ensure the pressure stays on longer. I use this for cleaning my standup paddle board at the beach and feet. Also use it for camping and washing hands, and the handle lock allows us to wash hands-free."

A relief valve can help take out the pressure so the sprayer can be stored away more effortlessly and without having to worry about pressure getting so high, that components or the bottle itself would explode or fail. With that said, the Futone has the valve implemented in such a way, pressure escapes the bottle even when not in use. That requires more hand pumping to reach the desired pressure level. With that said, I prefer this bottle without the relief valve because the pressure will stay and requires less pumping. I do not like that the handle lock takes some effort to put in place, but once it's working, it sprays well. What do I use this for? Cleaning my standup paddle board at the beach, my hands, feet. For camping. It's really convenient and my friends actually all asked which one I recommend. This one's not bad, but if the handle lock loosens up a bit, it'll be a good recommendation."
Ronny Acosta,"I have a small desk that I work on and this keyboard really helps on saving space. Using this is really easy to use. All I have to do is plug in the USB plug that connects not only the keyboard but also the mouse. If I need to use this away from my desk, I found that I can stand or sit roughly 5-6ft away and this will still work with my computer. I do make sure that there is no interference though. The keyboard is really light weight and is a very decent sized keyboard. The mouse can be used on either a mousepad or with no mousepad. Depending on the surface, there are times where I don't but I did attempt to use this on a glass covered surface and found it a little harder to use and did need something underneath. If I don't use the keyboard for about 10 minutes, it will automatically turn off, same with the mouse. To turn it back on or to resume using it, I just press any key and it will start back up without typing whatever I push. Great to use for traveling too."
Ronny Acosta,"I have a small half bathroom but barely has any room for storage. This shelf is not only perfect but fits in between the toilet and wall perfectly. It's not too high but not too low either. I'm able to store more than enough toilet paper inside of this without having to worry about it falling. Putting this together was really easy to do and the instructions were really clear. Not to mention, I wasn't missing any parts either. I did thoroughly check all pieces and parts and none of them were damaged either. I've now been using this storage cabinet for over a month now and not only has it been helpful but love that it fits perfectly in this small bathroom. Really easy to clean and even when I use windex or wipes, the paint does not come off either."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have a Tacklife electric standing desk and several drawers I tried did not fit because the motor and rod were in the way. This Vivo one, although narrow, fits well because it can be lowered just enough to clear the motor's rod. Installation was simple and straight-forward. Feels sturdy."
Ronny Acosta,"I have about a 6ft tree already up and was looking to redo my Christmas decorations in gold and silver and this tree skirt is perfect. Not only is it a great size for my tree, which is fake, but it hides the ugly stand underneath. The skirt itself arrived very wrinkled but I was able to wash and hang dry this and the wrinkles were gone. After I put this in the washer, which was put on the gentle cycle, I was afraid the sequins were going to fall off but all of them are still attached. Not to mention, none of them came loose or bent. The underneath part of the skirt is a soft white satin that can be seen just a bit around the edges but I think it kind of gives it a little pop. Even with my cats laying on the skirt, the tree skirt still looks great. Really easy to set up too."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have an investment property with a storage space where I put all my repair gear and tools. It often is hard to see in the one-car sized space, particularly with shelves on all 4 sides. A single light bulb in the middle does not help with looking for items. This one solved the problem by allowing the light be pointed in 3 different ways. They are also very bright. Screw into a standard socket, and you are good to go. Because they are LED, they also won't generate much heat and should last for a LONG time"
Ronny Acosta,"I have been able to use this stove while camping and even at home. I have a tent that actually allows me to have a stove inside of it, mainly for winter. I tested this out in the tent and not only does it fit, but I didn't have to worry about smoke leaking out of the stove area but all the smoke went out of the pipe. When it came to putting this stove together, it came with everything that I needed with a few extra screws. It even came with tools but I found that using my own tools made putting this together a lot faster. Not to mention, I was able to tighten the screws a lot better. More importantly, there was no smoke at all leaking from any corner, crease or even the front part. I recently used this on an overnight camping trip and not only was I able to cook my food on this but it helped with keeping me warm as the temperature dropped down to the low 50's and high 40's at times. So easy to use and when it comes to cleaning out, just wait for it to cool and I'm able to dump out the ash. Great quality stove and just be careful when lit as the sides can get really hot."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have been buying this particular one about 4 or 5 times now for myself, parents, brother, and a vacation home. It's essential to keep the fireplace flue cracked open a bit to allow any carbon monoxide gas to escape. Prevents the flue from shutting entirely. First time I got one, I did not know how to attach it to the damper, and it fell out from behind. Could not fish it out any more. So, hang on to it carefully. The original purchases only had 1 bolt included. That made it not fit for some thin dampers and perhaps that's why there are now 2 included: one short, one long. You screw in both from both sides to secure thin dampers or you use either the short or long one to accommodate different fireplace configurations."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have been camping for decades and have bought countless amounts of gear over the years for a variety of activities: car camping, glamping, RV'ing, wilderness backpacking, and lately, overlanding/boondocking/dispersed camping. My backpacking gear alone totals to probably $3,000 now. With all that said, I had never considered getting this camp strap. Just never had a need to. I'd usually just put up a rope and hang things off carabiners or make some neat knots. Well, consider me convinced that this 1lb camp strap is actually quite useful. For one, carabiners no longer slide all over the rope and everything stays in place! Will it hold up well against the weather, particularly the rainy kind? We shall see."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have been doing DIY projects for more than a decade now and recently bought a vacation home in the mountains with my family. We learned about winterizing the home not too long after and were immediately concerned considering that winter is coming. What does that mean? We need to ensure that cold air stays out and heat stays in. We also need to make sure the water pipes don't freeze and later burst.

One of the tools I had long been looking for was a thermal imaging camera. Flir was in my crosshairs for a long time, but wow, those things are PRICEY! Then came the Hikmicro for a far lower price. Mind you, I never had a Flir to directly compare against, and this would be the first time I would finally be using a thermal camera.

First, using it is FUN! You could see in one of the photos that there was still heat remaining on the sofa where the pictured person was sitting just a minute prior. I was also able to find a wet towel that was hanging to dry -- I was not aware there was one until there was a dark, purple spot on the camera surrounded by warmish tones. It also spotted heat from my speakers that were off. Went outside to my car that I drove about an hour ago -- and the hood area was still lighting up yellow/orange from the motor heat. Pointed it down to my crotch and was able to identify where my private part was at. Yep, I did that! I never knew that was in my pants ;) It was interesting to see my butt print on the sofa after just sitting there for a few seconds and immediately pointing the camera at it from a distance. Next, I took it to our mountain home and pointed it outside the building to measure the temperature difference between the exterior and the area surrounding pipes and vents going into the house. I did the same from inside the home to look for purple areas where it should be warm. In the summer, it would be the opposite: looking for warm areas where it should be purple. Such was how I found air leaks/drafts throughout the house (like windows, attic, walls -- even found where the previous owner patched a wall and did not fully close the exterior, plumbing in the bathrooms, and doors). Sealed all of those immediately, and it was not long until the entire scanned area came out around the same temperature. That should save us $100s in electric costs over the next few years. There is a slot for a memory expansion card, and you could take photos and videos. I wish there was a way to connect via an app or directly record the videos onto a smartphone for easier sharing, but I later found that there's the B20 model that has a companion app. One lens is for the thermal core that detects heat through infrared emissions. The other lens is an optical camera that works with the thermal core for additional functionality. Configuration options include the ability to adjust temperature sensing range so you can find water leaks, for example. The colors on the screen constantly shifted in relation to the temperature the cursor was pointed at. At $500, the tool is not inexpensive. But compared to a comparable Flir model, this is much more affordable. I am glad to have this tool in my DIY arsenal. It will come in very handy."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have been pellet grilling with a Z Grills for almost a year now. It was definitely a learning curve compared to my Masterbuilt Electric Smoker (MES). This particular book is well-suited for the beginner smoker: it covers why a pellet grill is good, goes over some smoking and grilling basics and processes, and how to use the grill itself. One you familiarize yourself with the basics, the recipes are easy to follow, though I wish that better (or more) pictures were provided. All in all, the author did a great job with which an amateur could start with. By the way, check out the 3-2-1 method!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have been vegetable/herb gardening for about a year and been growing fruit trees since about 8 years ago (with lots of initial failures). It was good to see how this book covers a wide variety of gardening concepts that are easy to understand and supported with good illustrations and photos. It goes through the type of soil composition to use for what types of plants and even how to build your own, raised bed garden. I actually learned a few tips here and there for myself, too."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have crab grass that's been filling up our entire backyard ever since we bought our home seven years ago. Crab grass grows fast and is an invasive weed. Because it's weed, I learned that you can slowly kill crab grass by watering less often and deeper into the soil so that only good grass' roots can get water. With that in mind, I wanted to put that knowledge to the test by ripping out some large portions of crab grass from the back yard. TIP: water the soil a bit so it's easier to rip the crab grass out. Once the ground was bare soil, I loosened it up a bit and pulled out any remaining crab grass/dead weed. Next, I sprinkled Scotts Turf Builer grass seeds onto a small section to see what would happen. Two weeks later, grass grew. Nice! I changed my sprinkler to water every 2 days for 5 minutes. End result? Grass grew after a week, and it has increasingly become fuller! With all that said, about 3 months later, I added this fertilizer. Note that it does NOT contain seeds. Instead, its content is used to promote the growth of existing, desirable grass. It worked... to some extent. It did not get rid of all the crabgrass, and so I am a bit skeptical about investing in more for weed control, but the grass did continue growing and turn darker green compared to the areas I did not sprinkle this fertilizer onto. Once the grass has grown acceptably, change the sprinkler system to water less frequently again (but deeper through cycle soaking) in order to starve the crab grass weed of water and to help the new grass establish deeper roots. SUMMARY: water often in the first 2 weeks to help sprout the new grass. Once it's established, water less frequently (but cycle soak) so the new grass grows deeper roots. Use this fertilizer to promote better health for existing grass to help its growth, but do not expect it to kill all the crabgrass in the yard because it did not for me."
Ronny Acosta,"I have gone through several different types of TENS units and I always seem to have the same issue, I'm not able to either get the correct setting or what I am exactly trying to hit. With this TENS unit, the complete opposite. There are so many choices that at first I felt a bit overwhelmed but then realized, this was what I have been wanting and looking for. The pads that comes with this unit are all different sized and shaped. At first I was a little annoyed but then realized that in some spots it works great for the smaller ones but then the bigger ones help so much better with like my sciatica problems. There are so many different options that no matter the type of pain or if I'm just wanting a certain type of massage, this unit does them all. What great about this TENS unit is it's fully rechargeable so I'm not going through batteries like crazy. Plus the pads, I've been able to use some of the same ones over and over and they still stick onto my skin, I just make sure that I wipe it down with an alcohol wipe before hand. So easy to use and so much relief."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have many similar water pump sprayers -- same size, nearly the same design, and usability. It does not have a pressure relief valve, however. A relief valve can help take out the pressure so the sprayer can be stored away more effortlessly and without having to worry about pressure getting so high, that components or the bottle itself would explode or fail. On the other hand, not having a relief valve also helps ensure the pressure stays on longer. I use this for cleaning my stand up paddle board at the beach and feet. Also use it for camping and washing hands, and the handle lock allows us to wash hands-free."
Ronny Acosta,"I have now owned and used these lights since they arrived almost 2 months ago. Even with several high wind storms and some heavy rain, these lights are still working. I have even had a mister hit these to help remove some of the dirt and dust on them and no matter the water or wind, these lights still work great. They are really easy to hang as I just used some old hooks that I had in my patio. The lights themselves perfectly light up my patio and give off a great ambiance. These did arrive in a box that had each bulb completely protected. The cords on these are really strong and long enough that they practically covered my whole patio or at least where I wanted them at. They provide a great amount of light and look great."
Ronny Acosta,"I have old wooden floors in my living and dining area and my kids are not very easy when it comes to moving the chairs and table around. Before ordering these, we had just had the floors redone when one of them scratched the floor so bad we had to have someone come out and repair it again. These go over practically any size of legs and I say that because our chairs are all different sizes and even the legs on our table are a different size. When we first put them on, they were a little hard but luckily these do have some stretch to them. Depending on the type of leg that is on our chair, some we were able to roll these down and then roll them onto the legs. Some of the bigger, square sized legs took a little more effort to put on. Even with all the moving around with the chairs and table, they slide around our floor without damaging our floors. We do have pets and these will occasionally collect fur around the bottoms but to clean them, I just wipe them with a damp cloth."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have over 4 of these kayak seats, and surprisingly, they all look and feel exactly the same as if they all came from a single supplier -- with their own branding slapped on. Color scheme is as shown: black with a gray center. Foam padding that resists water and corrosion -- and feels comfortable to sit on. Straps located at the top and bottom back. Top ones attach to the D-Rings up front, bottom to the ones at back. Bag can be left to hang off the back or be detached and placed underneath the webbing at the front or back of the paddle board or kayak. Water resistant, but not waterproof. Meaning: you cannot and should not submerge under water (like what could happen if the floating device flips or briefly sinks). Keep your sensitive things in a waterproof bag for good measure. If used in saltwater, be sure to rinse the entire seat, especially the metal clips to minimize damage and metal corrosion. If you want to learn how to attach these seats to your paddle board, you will need to have D-Rings installed/glued onto your SUP/iSUP. Search Google for ""YuenX paddle board to kayak conversion"" for a good how-to."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have purchased some products from Good Life before. The most recent one was their Beet ketchup that tasted nearly like ketchup, but healthier and with far less sugar. I was looking forward to trying out this Salsa one. There was a problem, however. The first bottle came with the cap smacked around during shipping, causing some liquid to leak. Even though the plastic wrapper was still on, the cap was very loose. My wife and I were hesitant to try out the salsa because we did not know how long that bottle had been unsealed. We did not want to risk poisoning ourselves or our children. So, we reached out to the manufacturer and explained our situation. They shipped us a replacement right away and it arrived in perfect condition. I provided them with some extra feedback on how to possibly help keep the bottles better protected for shipping. We chilled the replacement bottle for some time and then came the taste test: it was tangy, packed mild heat, and was quite delicious. Well done! We enjoyed it with some salsa and pita chips. I had also recently used it as a topping on CPK pizza. Customer service has been great and so far, 2 out of 2 of their products had been delicious. The ingredients also were easy and clear to read. Meaning: no artificial flavors or preservatives."
Ronny Acosta,"I have sciatica issues and this seat cushion not only pads my computer chair but helps with my sciatica pain. Normally when I have to sit for long periods of time, since that is what my job requires me to do, I normally have to keep getting up because my sciatic acts up. Since getting this cushion, I've had less and less problems when I do have to sit for long periods of time. This did come vacuum sealed in a bag which did mean I had to wait a few hours before testing this. I have antique wooden chairs and that is the first place I tried these. Normally I don't last more than 5 minutes sitting in these chairs but after 30 minutes, I was still sitting comfortable in them. The cover on this does come off which has allowed me to wash this in my washer but I do hang dry this just in case it might shrink. Even with the daily use this cushion gets, it is still comfortable and has not lost it's form."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have several camping shovels for boondocking/overlanding/dispersed camping. This one is supposedly a MILITARY shovel -- if so, it is quite heavy. Does the military carry such heavy shovels? Perhaps. I do not know. What I do know is that it is versatile in the way it can be used to dig a good amount of dirt and to clear debris with. Would I take it camping? Perhaps. Perhaps not. I might be a bit overkill for camping, but better to have something that is too useful than not, right? This shovel felt very solid and sturdy. Material looks to be of good quality."

Ronny Acosta,"I have taken this solar charger for every hiking, camping and really any trip that I go on. Not only has it come in handy so many times, the amount of battery power this charger has is way more than I thought I was going to get. When you use the solar charger part, it is a slow charging power but found that if I fully charge this at home before I leave, it will usually last me throughout my whole trip, depending on how much I use it and how long my trip is. I recently went on a camping trip that also had me hiking and kayaking. I was not only able to use it that whole 4 day trip, but it hooks onto my backpack with no issues. The light on this is a lot brighter than I thought it was going to be. If you turn the flashlight on, it turns on solid bright light. If you press it again, the lights do a slow flash and then if you press it again, the flash is faster. The end that has the plugs is covered with a lid that keeps dirt and debris from getting inside. Overall, this charger is really great for trips and does charge phones a lot faster than my charger in my car does."
Ronny Acosta,"I have tall windows that I have a hard time cleaning, outside and inside and with this squeegee I'm able to get them both. For the outside, I included a picture of what it looks like before and then cleaning the one next to it with this squeegee. I have tried the attachable hose window cleaners but am always left with streaks. With this squeegee, my windows are completely streak free. I have several windows in my house that normally require me to get the ladder out to clean. However, with this squeegee I no longer have to use the ladder. What I love is that it's not just easy to use but even with having to clean higher windows, this doesn't buckle or bend while wiping those windows. I thought for sure because of how long the pole goes that it would possibly bend in the middle but that isn't the case with this. I'm able to use window cleaner or just soap and water to clean with. I'm even able to finally clean my high mirror without the ladder too. No streaks and clean windows and mirrors."
Ronny Acosta,"I have the regular outdoor sting lights but wanted to add some color out there and these are perfect. Unlike my other string lights that come on with a flip of the switch, I'm able to not just turn them on that way but also change the colors and how the light up with just a quick tap on my phone. The app was really easy to setup and connecting them to my lights was really easy. The only word of advice that I have is to make sure they are turned on before attempting to connect to the app. Once they're connected, turning them on or off with just the app is really easy to do. What I thought was really cool is that if I have music playing from my phone, they lights will actually go to the music if I want them too. These were so much fun to use during out Halloween party and a few other birthday parties. They really do light up our patio too. Not to mention, they are so much easier to use than our other lights. Really does add to our patio and love that we're able to use our phone."
Ronny Acosta,"I have tried several elderberry gummies and normally they have a disgusting taste to them. With these gummies, they actually don't have that gross medicine taste to them. They do taste a bit sweet but are actually great tasting and not disgusting. The other great thing about these gummies is they don't feel as though they are trying to pull the fillings out of my teeth when I chew these. When they say gummies, these really are in fact gummies and are easy to chew and swallow. Even after taking these, I don't have any gross after taste either. I do suggest keeping these away from where it can get humid as they can get a little sticky but other than that issue, great tasting and so far working. Plus, they don't interfere with my other medications that I take."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I have used these bumpers to lower the noise of closing cabinets, protect the surface from scratches and vibrations, and keep glass tops (or laptops/keyboards) from moving on the table. For all these purposes, the bumpers work very well. It Sticks well, Soft and non-slip, Dampening effect and Easy to apply, but be sure to clean the surface first with a mild cleaner or alcohol (grab the bumper by the side without touching the glue and press firmly onto the surface). None that I can think of. Won't work as well if removed and re-applied? Overall, I like these bumpers. They have a wide variety of uses as I had described in this review."
Ronny Acosta,"I have used this leash with my small dog that knows how to walk with a leash and my larger dog who will still tug at the leash. No matter what dog I'm walking with this leash, this leash works with either with no problem. This leash has gotten wet and even a little muddy but this leash still works great even when soaked in water. The strength of this leash has definitely surpassed my expectations. Even with the dog that is constantly tugging trying to chase little critters, this leash will hold them without tearing or ripping. Even with our new puppy who we have caught several times chewing on this, it still has not shredded even with those sharp teeth. Great quality and works with any size dog."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I honestly did not expect much from this product. But, it looks quite professional, sleek, and fits my car interior well. Most people would think it's a cup, but it's of course a garbage can in disguise. The included trash bags are twice as big as the can itself, and so I feel that it's wasted plastic. In any case, I do not plan to use it with perishable items, but rather with just papers and smaller trash items. The cup unscrews from the bottom, you then place the plastic bag over it, and screw it back together. Could you do without this cup? Of course. But it certainly looks nice to have trash neatly hidden away from sight. I wished they made a larger one in diameter so we could fit larger trash items."
Ronny Acosta,"I hung these lights on my mantle to go with the rest of my Christmas decorations and they look amazing. The lights themselves are round circles that have rubber decorations that perfectly fit inside of them. The strings that these hang down from even light up. They were really easy to hang and at first I thought they were going to be in the way but they're actually not. My mantle is about 8ft long and what I love is that the extra string part that just lights up, I was able to turn it back around and have it sit on my mantle. This does require AA batteries that this did not come with but I've had these up and one for almost a month now. I am just now having to change the batteries because we have accidentally left these on overnight several times. They do not go through batteries a lot but look great on my mantle and can't wait to see when I hang our stockings."
Ronny Acosta,"I hurt my neck and shoulder and have been using this heating pad to help loosen up the muscles. Not only does it cover the whole area but even with my back, it covers everything. The size of this heating pad is just a little more than double the size of my old heating pad. Not to mention, heats up so much better. My old one only has low and high settings, meaning I can only choose 2 temperatures. With this heating pad, I have multiple temperatures I can choose from. Rather than just high and low, the temperatures are regulated with numbers, 1-6. I've tried the 1 and 2 but found with extreme muscle pain, I use either 3 or 4. I've gone up to 5 and 6 but those are too hot for me. Either way, this heating pad has so many different levels of heat and it helps so much better than my old one. Great for anyone and any size."
Ronny Acosta,"I included pictures and a video from when I first opened them in the package when they arrived. As you can see, they are some what flat and this is because they arrived vacuum sealed in a bag. However, after waiting a few days, I noticed that they were not rising. After some research I read that it helps to soak them in a tub to allow them to soak up water for an hour or so. I then gently squeezed some of the water out and left them outside to dry. Once they were fully dry, I did notice some were still flat and so I just soaked them with a hose and did it all over again. Not only did this help getting them to their full size, but they actually did expand a little more in the width too. When it comes to actually preventing echoing, they really do work. I only needed a little bit because I only needed to partially cover a wall, but when it comes to installing these, they were really easy to do. Not only do they stick very well, but they really do prevent any excess echoing that I had before. The foam itself is fairly thick, once they have expanded and as long as they are fully dry, they stick really good. I have had these up for about 2 months now and not only are they still sticking onto my wall, but they are still preventing echoing. When it comes to cleaning them, I just use a regular duster and this seems to do the trick just fine."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I installed this onto my electric bike, replacing the factory stem. I wanted my handlebars to be raised up more for easier, recreational riding and to also have my son have better grip when sitting in front of me on the MTB Shotgun child seat. Installation was not immediately straight-forward, particularly with the lack of any instruction manual included. I essentially had to take it apart to fit onto my bike, but once all was said and done, it felt very sturdy and added good height."

Ronny Acosta,"I keep this tire inflator in my car for not just in case moments but found that this has helped with all of my kids' ride on toys, especially when we are out at the parks or even out of town. With the plug, I'm able to plug this into my car and use it while my car is on, of course. I have used this to help inflate tires, when there is no gas station around. What I love most about this tire inflator is that it comes with everything to not just inflate my tires but also my kids' ride on toys and balls. The inflator itself has a hidden compartment that I'm able to store the plug which helps and prevents me from losing the cord. This fits perfectly inside of my trunk without taking up a lot of space. When it comes to inflating my car tires, it can take a bit, but it depends on how low my tires are. When it comes to bikes and balls, this inflates in no time. Really comes in handy more times than I can count."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I love green and black tea and often make them on cold winter days. They are always very soothing. Chamomile tea is also very tasty and particularly popular in Germany and Austria (where I grew up as a child). Be sure you brew it at the right temperature and the right amount of time: 200F for 5-8 mins, almost like black tea. Enjoy with some honey. Because this tea is Caffeine-free, it is excellent for pregnant women. (Note: I am not a doctor and this should not be construed as medical advice.)"

However, I am not an expert with matcha and cannot comment on the quality between this and other brands. Yes, this product is USDA certified, and perhaps for the purist, it is Japan-certified as authentically Japanese. Does it make a difference for the cakes we have made with it and other brands? Nope. Maybe a professional cook could discern the difference."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"I love hazelnut and chocolate. Nutella is something I grew up with. Do these paper-thin wafers taste the same way? Nope. They are more on the bland side, but certainly do have the consistency and taste of thin wafers. I add them to ice cream. Negates the fact that these are designed to be less sugar rich, doesn't it? I had a big concern when I saw the warning label on the front of the product packaging. It was in Spanish, but my limited Spanish knew that it was enough to look up what it meant: ""Contiene edulcorantes no recomendable para niños"". That translates to: ""Contains sweeteners not recommended for children"".  What does that mean? Can potentially lead to diabetes.  According to HealthyChildren, 'Recent research suggests possible links between nonnutritive sweeteners and changes in appetite and taste preferences in children. This, in turn, could affect weight and health. Other research is looking into whether these sweeteners cause changes in the gut microbiome?which is made up of ""friendly"" bacteria--and may affect blood sugar levels and lead to metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes.' Site continued, ""It is currently unclear whether there are any long-term health effects from these products on children.""

Ronny Acosta,"I love these headphones for working out because no matter how much I move, I'm able to still keep these on. I bought these to help with listening to either music, shows or even movies while I'm working out without disturbing others either at home or at the gym. However, I even found myself using these at home to listen to different workout videos. When it comes to sound quality, especially during the workout videos, I'm not having to second guess where I'm at or what move to do. Everything is completely clear and depending on the volume, these really can be noise canceling. The best part, no matter if I'm running, walking, bending or even laying down, these headphones stay in and on my ear without having me constantly adjusting them. Easy to connect to either my phone, tablet or even the bluetooth adapter I have on my TV. Long battery life too."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I mixed in some of the seasoning with my Killer Hogs BBQ Rub for a side-by-side comparison of chicken legs without the green chili. I do not know much about these Korean chili peppers, but they certainly pack a punch of heat that slowly creeps up in a pleasant way. The taste test after 2 hours of smoking with Jack Daniels barrel wood smoke? Our family had mixed opinions. I liked the chicken with and without the chili seasoning, though I did have to give a slight nod to the spicier ones. My wife was in love with the ones seasoned with the chili. Mother-in-law said it was too spicy. My 6-year-old son liked the chili ones too, but he had to have a cup of milk nearby."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"I never cared for bath bombs as I thought of them to be gimmicky with scents, aromatherapy, and what not. I'm just a simple shower guy who used to enjoy playing with bubbles as a kid. Well, I have two children and they both sort of enjoy bath time, but it's usually short-lived because we, as parents, don't want to spend so much time supervising them with all the work we have to do after they go to sleep. But come on now... I'm a fun dad. Not a boring one, right? Decided to get bath bomb for the heck of it. Threw one into the tub, turned on the water... and... the kids went ECSTATIC! THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVED it! They smell good (again, not something I enjoy bathing with, but the kids do) and bubbles are always, always fun! Toys pop out of the bombs, but be sure to still supervise so the young ones don't swallow. You should be watching the kids anyway as it only takes a few seconds for one to accidentally drown. Okay, kids love them, daddy loves watching them enjoy themselves, and so that's what matters the most."
Ronny Acosta,"I normally have to buy either a size up or even 2 sizes up with some of these outfits but with this one, I actually ordered my size and it fit perfectly. Even with being busty, the top still fit perfectly and is really comfortable to wear. Even when it first arrived, I tried this on and found that the top wasn't too tight. The pants do go a little past my ankles but I stand at 5'4"" so I have this problem with majority of my pants. However, I'm still able to wear these with or without socks. Even after washing and drying this jogging suit, it not only still fits great but even looks great on. The fabric is really soft and that is without using fabric softener. Even after washing and drying this before wearing, I checked the stitching and I have not seen any of the stitching or thread start to come loose. Not only that, but the black or the blue does not bleed through and stain my undergarments. Really comfortable to wear and helps keep me warm but not too warm."
Ronny Acosta,"I normally wear a 2XL in clothing and after reading the measurements, I decided to order a size up. I'm glad I did because this track suit fits me perfectly. The pants are not too thin and not too thick. They are perfect for fall and even winter. While I am busty, the jacket still zips over my chest area. I stand about 5'5"" and not only do these pants fit perfectly, but they completely cover my ankles. The jacket and pants are made of the same material and is really soft. I have already worn this several times and not only has it kept me warm but not overly hot even with walking around. When it comes to washing, I'm able to throw these in the washer and dryer without having them fade, fall apart or having the dye become streaked. Even with all the zipping, the zipper still works too."
Ronny Acosta,"I normally would have to fill a storage bag with ice in order to get an ice pack on my face when I'm having a migraine, headache or even sinus pressure. However, unlike that storage bag, I no longer have to worry about water leaking out with this ice pack mask. Not to mention, I'm able to adjust this to where I'm having pain and keep the ice pack on. Even with moving around while laying down, this mask stays on without moving around and causing me to move it. While it does get really cold, the covering that holds the ice pack, helps prevent the ice pack itself from touching my face. What I love about this mask is its fully washable and the ice pack is fully removeable. Really comfortable to wear and really helps with any pain."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I once purchased a SealLine see-through dry bag for a trip to the Zion Narrows in Utah to protect my Canon EOS 5D Mark III DSLR with 24-70mm f/2.8L lens. I loved it at the time because its see-through ability allowed me to quickly check what was happening inside the bag. It protected my camera gear very well, and garnered quite a few looks and compliments. It worked very well. The 10L was a perfect size for me to put the camera + lens in, plus a fleece jacket, and lunch (for 2 people). The 5L is a good size for a single paddle boarder to hold some water, snacks, phone, wallet, keys, and a jacket. If you fully inflate it and only seal the top with a few turns, there's so much air left inside, it was actually staying afloat long enough for me to grab had I forgotten to secure it to the paddle board. Obviously, you should ALWAYS have it secured or you could potentially kiss your gear good bye! To inflate the bag (keeping air filled in) to ensure it floats in the water, fold the top several times to seal the opening shut, and clip the top to use it as a convenient carrying handle (or to a backpack while hiking through the Zion Narrows). The bag itself can be carried over-the-shoulder."
Ronny Acosta,"I ordered a size up on these pants and I am glad I did. They do run about 1 size down but these are more of a slim fit. The pants themselves are really comfortable and found that I have worn these not just to workout in but to also do things around the house and out of the house. The pockets are deep enough that they not only hold my wallet but my keys and occasionally my phone when I need to put it away. The drawstring on these pants really does help when it comes to keeping these on, especially when I put a lot of stuff in my pockets. The pants are not too tight but even after washing and drying, they have not shrunk at all. Even the seems on these pants are all still intact. Great quality sweatpants and do keep me warm. Great now because the weather is starting to get colder now."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I ordered one of these for our mountain vacation home to be used on a glass table top. It fits beautifully with our mountain theme and looks to be well-made. It stands up sturdy and the slightly raised clearance gives it a feeling of some balance. The only concern I have is that metal sliding across a glass table top may not be a good idea concerned about potential scratches, but thankfully, that has not yet been the case. This was a good purchase."
Ronny Acosta,"I ordered this in a XXL which I wear between an XL or XXL depending on the sizing and this fits perfectly. I am busty and normally wear between a size 16/18 and this fits without being too tight in any area. The fabric on this is really soft too. The sleeves on this shirt are long and do come a little past my wrist but I love when they do. If I do need to roll my sleeves up, they're not too tight that I can't get them up either. I have thrown this in my wash and dryer several times now and this shirt still looks the same as the day I got it last month. The print on this shirt is still clear and shows no signs of cracking or peeling. Even the seems are still all attached and show no signs of coming unattached. I have actually fallen asleep in this shirt on a few occasions and it still looks great. What I love about this shirt is not only does it fit great but even if I raise my arms up, this shirt still covers my stomach."
Ronny Acosta,"I originally bought these to store my spices but found that I use this in my bathroom to help store other things. The racks themselves are lightweight but are a lot tougher than they look. When it comes to using these, I did make sure they were going to fit inside my drawer, which they do. The cabinets I have were built in late 50's, early 60's and surprisingly these fit inside perfectly. I have 2 drawers that are small but with these racks inside, I'm able to store medications, makeups and even some melting wax for my waxer. When it comes to cleaning these, I just take a paper towel or rag and just wipe them clean. There was an incident that did require me to remove 1 of them and actually wash it but I was able to just use soap and water with a sponge and it was clean again. They're really easy to use and the shelf is wide enough to hold just about any size bottle or tube. Great quality material and they don't seem to break easily, at least for me."
Ronny Acosta,"I originally bought this bed for my large dog but found that it will fit both my medium and large dog, at the same time. I will catch both of them sleeping on this together and there is actually more than enough room for both. I should also mentioned that I ordered the large sized bed. When it comes to washing the cover, I just unzip and throw it in the washer and dryer. When it arrived vacuum sealed, I saw that the cushion was taking forever to poof up. I ended up putting it outside and hosing it down. The cushion soaked up the water which cause it to poof up. It did take 2 of us to completely ring out the water and then we put it near our heater to help dry out the remaining water since it is cold now. Not only did this help but the cushion itself is actually very firm and provides them with more than enough padding. Since our dogs do shed, we have to wash and dry this practically every week but even with doing so, the cover still fits on the cushion and still works great."
Ronny Acosta,"I originally bought this for a gift for someone but as soon as it came in, they ended up with a gift card. The bag itself is so cute and love it for those times I just want a cute, quick bag to grab. The bag itself stands up on it's own and even when standing, it doesn't fall into itself. Very durable and will hold a lot of stuff. The strap is fully adjustable too. The soap and everything this comes with smells so good. The body wash and shampoo does feel as though it's drying out my skin or scalp. Even the shampoo doesn't leave my hair greasy either. The lotion is very moisturizing too. Normally I can be a little sensitive to scents but with this one, it's not overpowering but subtle. This would make a great gift but for me, I absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel and smell. Very long lasting too."
Ronny Acosta,"I originally bought this for my pug but while they do fit on this bed with some room, my lab mix will occasionally sleep in it when the pug isn't. While they fit perfectly with hardly any room left over, they still fit on this bed. They don't quite fit under the blanket but the pug and chihuahua that I have does fit underneath this blanket. The bed itself is really easy to clean and found that washing this by itself is a lot better than with other items as it does soak up a lot of water. However, even after putting this in my washer and dryer, the bed not only comes out fluffy but comes out with nothing wrong with it. The bed is super fluffy and fuzzy still. While it can get dirty fast, it's really easy to clean. Love that it has an attached blanket that will definitely come in handy, especially when it gets really cold."
Ronny Acosta,"I originally bought this for the sole purpose of being able to leave notes when I need to but found that I've been doing so much more. When it comes to using the app with this printer, it's really easy to use and navigate through. I'm not only able to write myself and others notes but can make lists with little character pictures on it and I'm even able to print out pictures that are on my phone. The templates that are included are really easy to add onto my notes. The printer itself is small enough to fit in my desk drawer without taking up a lot of space. When it comes to the print quality, it comes out really clear enough that anyone can read it. When it comes to pictures, they quality is clear but don't expect it to be clear like getting this printed at a professional photo printer. However, they're clear enough that I'm able to put them up at work. I have included what it looks like when printing a picture from my phone. Overall, this printer has been so much fun to use but really does come in handy for what I need it for."
Ronny Acosta,"I originally bought this shirt to do errands in or just lounge around the house. However, I find that I not only wear this for doing all of those things but have even used this for a night shirt. The shirt itself is really comfortable and isn't too thin or too thick. With the weather getting colder, I've found that I've been wearing this a little more often. I do wash this shirt and instead of drying, I do choose to hang dry. I ordered this shirt in a XXL which is the size of shirts I wear and this shirt fits with some space. I wasn't looking for a tight shirt but nothing too loose and this shirt is perfect. There is a front pocket which will actually fit a key fob and chapstick in it. Even with rolling these sleeves up, the openings don't stretch out easily. The fabric on this shirt is really soft too. As I am writing this, I'm actually wearing the shirt right now. Really comfortable to relax in and have worn this to bed more times than I can count. Even with wearing this as much as I have, it still is the dark green color as when I first got it. Quality stitching too."
Ronny Acosta,"I originally bought this specifically to replace an old beach tote and I'm so glad I did. Not only does this tote hold so much but it holds a lot more than our old one. I love the neoprene fabric as even if it does get wet, it dries extremely fast. The fabric itself is very thick and made of great quality. Even with everything I stuffed inside of this bag, not only did it not tear but it has a lot of stretch to it. Even with getting sand on the bottom, it is really easy to dust this bag off and have it clean once again. This bag came with a bottom piece that helps keep this bag have a solid bottom, however, if I don't want to use it I can just easily remove it and leave it. Great quality bag and it holds so much!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I own both a reflective, full vest and this strip vest. The former is, of course, much more visible due to being one, solid color wrapped all around the body, but it can also be too embarrassing for some to wear. This strip vest is a good compromise in that it does not trap heat you generate during workout, allows you to move more freely, and is still visible to drivers. It also does not scream ""dork"" like the full vests do. When I go biking or jogging, this is the one I choose to go with each time, but when full visibility or some sort of cold/wind protection is needed, I wear the full vest instead."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I own the $300 Snow Peak Takibi Fire and Grill (ST-032SET) and purchased it for camping, boondocking, or overlanding, but that darn thing is HEAVY. MUCH heavier than I had expected. As a result, I had only used it ONCE. Since that purchase a year ago, I had sort of been eyeing smaller designs that would be more portable (with the understanding that they would not be able to have a fire as big as the Snow Peak. Well, this Lieber one came along. (By the way, ""Lieber"" means ""Dear"" in German.) It is very small and much, much lighter in weight. How did it go? The moment you open it up, it has a very, very strong, chemical smell that usually accommodates new metals. Could it be safe to use? After leaving it out in the open for a couple days, the smell went away, but for good measure, a couple burns with firewood got rid of the rest. Now it is safe to use for cooking food. Case has no lock to hold everything in. So, be sure to have the bag handy so nothing can spill out the moment the case opened up. Setup was a breeze. Simple and fast, though no instructions were provided. Just look at the pictures and you'll be able to figure it out. Takedown was even faster. Grill is rather flimsy, and so if you want to cook heavier items, consider bringing sturdier things like pans or a solid grill top. Consider getting a fire pit mat to help protect the ground and to keep ember a bit more in check so you won't cause an accidental fire or burn whatever the grill was placed over. Overall, at $50, this grill is much cheaper, lighter, and convenient to carry around than the $300 Snow Peak that only had found use ONCE."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I purchased 16 of these over the past 12 or more years. Like the fact that they are fire/carbon monoxide combos and should last roughly 10 years. They should be replaced at least every 10 years.

I bought 6 of these last week and installed them into each bedroom and hallway across 3 floors.

Last night, one randomly sounded ""Fire"" at 6am. Fire was nowhere to be found. We reset and reseated the battery and got the same result. Placed 2 other Kidde into the same room and the other two did not alarm. That led me to conclude that one is defective. Could not initiate automatic return with Amazon and had to go through a troubleshooting session with Amazon instead. He later determined that a replacement would be sent free of charge.

Beeping was loud enough for me to hear from a closed, third floor room to where I slept on the second floor (no door), but wife heard nothing behind the closed door of her room on the same floor. Our son did, however. He slept on the same bed as hers.

Be sure to read the instructions on proper placement of the alarms onto the wall or ceiling."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I purchased a couple set of similar ones by Paliston back in 2018 and have loved them. This awkwardly-named brand, Bnyzwot, works the same way, and as such my review of it will be similar to what I wrote for the Paliston. I am an avid hiker, camper, and wilderness backpacker. Over the years, I used to purchase inexpensive Coleman carabiners from Walmart to hang lightweight things in place, especially since I seem to keep losing them or lend them out to fellow hikers (and never get them back). I wanted cheaper alternatives so I would not cry over losing them. For $10, this set actually presents a pretty good value -- they came out cheaper than the Coleman ones AND are twist lock. Do note that these should NOT be used for climbing as they are not designed for such activity. Three years later, I still use the Paliston all the time: attaching things to my stand up paddle board, backpacks, pants (like a Hydroflask bottle for short hikes), and so on. Extremely versatile and useful. This Bnyzwot will add to that Paliston collection -- both brands are virtually indistinguishable from one another. Overall, this set of carabiners presents a great value."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I purchased some cheap respirators from Home Depot, and found them to be lacking: I had a hard time keeping the mask's shape, having to toss them after just a few uses. KN95's are China-equivalent to N95. This one holds its shape very well (and can be reused a couple times, depending on how long you had it on for). It protected me very well from dust/saw dust. It also protects better against Fiber (attic insulation) than the cheap ones I used. KN95 mask rating allows this to safely be used during wildfires/smokey days."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"I purchased the larger 14"" before and was thoroughly impressed by the build quality and compact size. I had the opportunity to also try the 8"" mini version for when I go solo boondocking or with my kid. Just like the larger version, it has similar pros and cons. Instructions ONLY came in Chinese and Japanese. Diagrams are thankfully understandable in any language, and so setup was easy to figure out. I own the $300 Snow Peak Takibi Fire and Grill (ST-032SET) and purchased it for camping, boondocking, or overlanding, but that darn thing is HEAVY. MUCH heavier than I had expected. As a result, I had only used it ONCE. Since that purchase over a year ago, I had sort of been eyeing smaller designs that would be more portable with the understanding that they would not be able to have a fire as big as the Snow Peak. Well, the 14"" CampingMoon one came along. (The brand claims to be focused on outdoor equipment.) It is very small and much, much lighter in weight. The moment you open it up, it did not feel as hefty strong as the Snow Peak, but considering that it is also much cheaper, that was to be expected.  There were no chemical smells. Excellent. Setup was easy. Takedown too. Grill is oversized so it wouldn't collapse onto itself. Then I tried the smaller 8"" version and like its larger sibling, it also felt well-made, had no chemical smell, and was easy to set up and take down. Its grill, because it was one sold piece, was extremely strong. Grilling height could be adjusted. Consider getting a fire pit mat to help protect the ground and to keep ember a bit more in check so you won't cause an accidental fire or burn whatever the grill was placed over. Overall, at $34, this grill is much cheaper, lighter, and convenient to carry around than the $300 Snow Peak or even its larger 14"" sibling. I have also used it as a personal fire pit."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I really did not know what to expect from this book. My son had been into science lately and the KiwiCo subscription had been expensive. Still, it's an investment for his curiosity, inquisitive mind, and development. This book can have parts folded into a variety of structures to demonstrate common, everyday science in a fun way. It is much more cost effective than KiwiCo, can more easily be brought onto trips, and encourages creativity. What a great concept! Hope to see more of this kind of book! Great job, David Eckold!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I really like these wipes. Honestly, I had very low expectations for these. They were much softer, yet more durable than I thought, and also importantly: had hardly any smell -- this is IMPORTANT for camping in bear country! Nothing is worse than having scented things in the car and have a bear come destroy the vehicle. With that said, because I was still able to smell SOMETHING, especially if you have used them to wipe your face or anything really, I would not keep the wipes in the car still. Bears can smell very, very well."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I really wanted to like this mount - It has a premium appearance to it with a wide, metal base that would help ensure a more firm clamp. Indeed, the clamp works very well, is tight, and secure, but there was some give to the arms themselves as if the tension was not enough for my 27"" and 30"" monitor, particularly for the larger one. I reached out to the seller and they sent me a replacement. The new one works MUCH better (though not ""perfectly"") -- both monitors now stay where they are supposed to. Overall, the monitor stand works well, and I must commend that customer service was good and took care of the issue with the first stand."

Ronny Acosta,"I recently lost all of my old hoop earrings and instead of having to purchase them one at a time, this set allowed me to have a variety that came in all sorts of different designs on them. I do have sensitive ears, which means so metals will make my ears start to itch after having them in for a few minutes. With these earrings, I have not had that problem with any of them. I did clean them all before putting them in my ears and I tested each pair. I wore each one for at least 10-15 minutes at a time. Not only did they not irritate my ears but I totally forgot I had them on until my timer went off. Really comfortable to wear and I'm still able to talk on the phone with them in my ears. Such a great variety too."
Ronny Acosta,"I recently used this on a hiking trip and this was so much easier than carrying my heavy binoculars. This was not only easier to hold but it fit in my cargo pocket with making them fall off. The clarity of this was really clear and if I needed to adjust it I was able to do so easily. What I love about this is it came with a mini tripod and a holder that allows me to connect my phone to this. I tried a similar one and when I connected my phone, I was never able to get a clear picture. Unlike that old one, with this monocular, I'm actually able to get a clear picture. I did find that with a newer phone, it was a little easier to get a clearer picture faster than with an older phone. However, the picture quality was still as if I was looking through the monocular myself. This does have a lens cap which really helps when it comes to protecting the lens and it doesn't fall off easily."
Ronny Acosta,"I replaced some old Christmas lights that I had in my patio with these lights and not only do they look great, but they look so festive. They were really easy to hang, as I just used my staple gun to hold the cords in place. The bulbs hang down and actually give my patio more than enough light to see without having to be enjoying the cool weather in the dark. What I love is this comes with a remote that allows me to either use these as a bright white or I can change the colors. I can even have these change on their own either fast or slowly. I was able to download the app and with the app, there are even more settings I can use with these lights. Remote and app are really easy to use. The colors are so bright and vibrant with these lights and love the design of the bulbs on them."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I saw non-mechanical ones used by my Physical Therapist to help stretch and loosen up my upper back. They did help provide some relief, and so I got one for myself at home instead of paying $$$ to go to the PT and use it.

Then I got myself this vibrating one to see how it would differ, but before doing so, I got my therapist's blessing first. He looked at it, had me give it a try with the vibration function -- which, by the way, felt a bit weird -- and he said, paraphrasing, ""Looks good. This should work better for you as the vibration will relax your muscles more."" Again, the vibration felt odd, but I kept with it for a few days, and surprisingly, I got used to it and increased the vibration strength. Once I was done with my exercises and turned off the vibration, that tingly sensation continued with my back and eventually I felt a bit more relaxed than with the non-mechanical foam one. The material is sturdy and solid, and for some, it may not be firm enough. It was worth the investment for me to be used each night (and some mornings) to help stretch. My toddler loves joining me whenever he sees me using it, it's quite cute."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"I start my fires with a combination of paper, dryer lint, ""Laughing Cow"" cheese wax wrappers, Doritos chips, coconut husks, wood chips, charcoal cloth, napkin dunked in olive oil, etc. Fire starter squares is another way to light fires with, and at 9 cents/square, it does not break the bank. One of the best parts is that it stayed lit for about 5 mins during my tests. A napkin dunked in olive oil burnt for about 40 mins in comparison. Surprisingly, it lit up with a lighter even when I had poured some water over it. It did NOT take a spark when wet, however. A single square is all you need, but like with anything, make sure you already have an ample supply of kindling, small twigs, Old Man's Beard, etc. available to nurture the small flame into a roaring fire. You could, of course, also just make your own. Take a bunch of cotton balls or fine wood chips and mix with vaseline."

Ronny Acosta,"I still have an old TV but what I love about this HDMI transmitter is that I'm actually able to connect this to my laptop and still be able to stream directly from that onto my television. This whole setup was really easy to do, after I read the instructions and then watched a few videos to make sure I was doing this correctly. However, after all was done and setup, this continues to work with no issues. The other thing I love about this is I'm also able to hook this up to my XBox and watch bluray movies that I have with that. The connection on with this transmitter is easy to connect and once it's connected, I have not had any issues with an glitching or it disconnecting. The picture quality on this is amazing and is almost as if I'm watching directly through my TV like a smart TV."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I suck at gardening. Or so it seems. Last year, I planted a 500 seed lettuce packet into small sections by accident sometime in the fall. Things got overcrowded quickly, and just when it was about time to harvest, caterpillars ate most of the harvest. I gave up. That winter, however, they all suddenly grew and I was able to enjoy them for a few months. Presumably, they grew because the pests were all dormant or gone over the winter season. I picked up this book to see what I could learn from it. The author provides easy-to-read, down-to-earth tips on how to deal with pests. Most included ways to get rid of them without harsh chemicals that could also affect the good kind of bugs. Whether that knowledge will be useful later, we shall see in the fall season when it's time to plant some veggies here again in sunny California."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I use these for keeping strawberries off the ground so they can last longer. However, I find it to be more effective when used in conjunction with weed barrier fabric and sprinkling wood chips all over the surrounding to help with moisture control of the top soil. Keep in mind that after every 5+ years, you will most likely have to fix parts of the barrier due to tears in the fabric. The plastic of this strawberry support will most likely also crack over time due to exposure to the elements, especially the sun."
Ronny Acosta,"I use this for work and not only is it great but it keeps my food cold. I work 12-15 hour days and even with putting ice packs in when I leave, I'm able to keep my food and drinks cold even when I'm getting out of work. I only put 2 regular sized ice packs in my backpack every morning when I leave and 12-15 hours later, they are still cold but more importantly, so is everything else inside. I did have some water leak out of a bottle but it didn't really leak outside of the backpack. There is a cinch lock as soon as I open it so that did help. When it comes to storage, there is more than enough room inside of this for not only my lunch but also drinks and snacks. What I love about this backpack is the storage and even the outside storage. I'm able to keep my phone charging cords, paperwork and even a powerbank with room left over. Really comfortable to wear and keeps everything cold."
Ronny Acosta,"I use this mainly for school and a side job that I do. What I love about this tablet is how easy it is to use. When it comes to connecting to either wifi, as long as I have everything on, it will connect a lot easier than a few name brand tablets that I've owned previously. When it comes to using any apps or just searching websites, I'm able to do practically everything I normally do from a laptop. This tablet is very light weight. Plus I was able to find a generic screen protector and case for it. When it comes to picture quality, this thing is amazing. I included a picture that I took with this tablet. I normally just take pictures of cards or people's faces but decided I wanted to see how it would be when it came to outdoor pictures. As you can see, the picture quality is so clear and beautiful. I applied no filters and no lights were used. Just nature as is. Love that I'm able to use this like any other name brand tablet but didn't have to pay the high price."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I use this to go camping/boondocking. So far, none but one had ripped. I had expected them to not last as strong as the heavy-duty trash bags (and I still do not believe they are), but for camping, they have held up fine so far."
Outdoor Enthusiast,I use this to hold long paper towels in the garage by having it attached to the side of our freezer. The ability to adjust its length and positioning makes it versatile to use for a variety of cases.
Ronny Acosta,"I used these lights for party decorations in mason jars. Not only did they look great but I was able to hot glue the power switch to the tops of the lids to help hide them. They are small enough that you can't even see them unless you looked in and was looking for it. Even with the hot glue, the plastic didn't melt. When it came to the lights, they not only looked great but the battery that came with these lasted throughout the party. They lit up the tables beautifully. They did come rolled up in a coil, but I was able to straighten them out and then roll them the way I wanted to. These are really easy to maneuver and can be used over and over again. The lights are not cheap and even with moving the wires around, none of them broke, cracked or had the lights come off. Really great lights and love that I'm able to reuse them."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I used to haul around our Costco-purchased table that folded in half and was a pain to carry around due to its weight. Lately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our family had been doing more camping while socially distancing away from everyone else. Some of the sites do not have tables available for us to use, and so we made some make-shift ones with boxes, smaller tables, and well... the heavy Costco one. I was very happy to see this table become available for review. First, it is quite obvious that it folds very narrow. It also is much, much lighter and easier to carry than Costco's. Setup was easy: extend the legs first, then snap on the table top. This table, however, is not without its flaws. It is lighter in weight and as such could also be blown away easier by stronger winds. So, be sure to anchor it down with heavier weights in windy conditions. It also is not as sturdy as a solid table -- it wiggles, and I definitely would not stand on it. So, count the drunken parties out of the question if you plan on doing a little performance/show on it. Count love making out as well, if your mind already is in the guts. It is strong enough, however, for changing babies' diapers. How's that for bringing your mind back down to reality? Yup, stinky poo and all. The table is small and not tall, and so its use is more limited to casual, low-height seat use. This table is good enough for us to take camping. I'll gladly now leave the Costco table at home and save my back, and now have more room in the car to carry other things to hurt my back with."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I used to haul around our Costco-purchased table that folded in half and was a pain to carry around due to its weight. Lately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our family had been doing more camping while socially distancing away from everyone else. Some of the sites do not have tables available for us to use, and so we made some make-shift ones with boxes, smaller tables, and well... the heavy Costco one. I was very happy to see this table become available for review. At $70, I would have checked it out anyway. First, it is quite obvious that it folds very narrow, but tall. It also is much, much lighter and easier to carry than Costco's as the table and leg parts come in two, separate compartments within the same carry bag. Setup was easy: extend the legs first, then snap on the table top. This table, however, is not without its flaws. It is lighter in weight and as such could also be blown away easier by stronger winds. So, be sure to anchor it down with heavier weights in windy conditions. It also is not as sturdy as a solid table -- it wiggles, and I definitely would not stand on it. So, count the drunken parties out of the question if you plan on doing a little performance/show on it. Count love making out as well, if your mind already is in the guts. It is strong enough, however, for changing babies' diapers. How's that for bringing your mind back down to reality? Yup, stinky poo and all. It is nice that the table's height can be adjusted to accommodate different uses. The aluminum top sometimes does come off and makes the table a bit awkward to move around at times. Wish there was a way to lock the top to the frame. This table is good enough for us to take camping. I'll gladly now leave the Costco table at home and save my back, and now have more room in the car to carry other things to hurt my back with. For $10 - $20 more, however, you could get a slightly larger one made by FiveJoy. I reviewed that one similar to this one."

Ronny Acosta,"I used to have this done but after my last horrible treatment, I decided I would do it myself. This kit not only comes with everything needed to curl my lashes but it actually makes them a lot darker than I thought they would. Normally I would have to apply a good amount of mascara to my eyelashes to get this dark coloring but since putting this tint on, I have not had to apply any mascara. My lashes are completely straight and after applying the tint, and the curl on only one side, I could see the difference of how dark my lashes are and how this kit actually did curl my lashes. I ended up applying the tint to my eyebrows as there are a little thin in the beginning and from the pictures I included, you can see the difference. Absolutely love this kit and that it really works. Not to mention, was really easy for me to do and this is my first time doing this myself."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I used to use aluminum foils to cover the stove, but what I did not like about them was that the foils eventually would burn black in some areas. Cleaning them would also be nearly impossible and it was just easier to trash them -- which, of course, isn't good for the environment either. So, I decided to give these protectors here a try since they are washable and fairly thick. Indeed, they work as expected, although the only issue I had was that they came too large. A simple trimming made them fit perfectly."

Ronny Acosta,"I wanted something more modern when it came to a knife set and this is perfect. I got tired of the traditional knife block and didn't want to hang them on a magnet due to still having little ones. The great thing about this is I'm able to see all of my knives without having to keep grabbing a handle thinking it was the right one. The bonus for me is not only does it look great but they work great too. They arrived already sharp and ready to use immediately out of the box. I did wash these and found that not only are they dishwasher safe but even with leaving these overnight in the sink with a little water, these do not rust easily like some big name brand knives I've had before. The handles are really comfortable to hold and whether I'm cutting frozen meat or something as soft as fresh baked bread, these cut with no issues."
Ronny Acosta,"I wanted something simple but this is beyond that. Not only does this inflate on it's own but it also lights up. I took pictures of what it looks like in the daytime and then when it's dark. During the day, you can see exactly what this is. At night though, that is when you only really see the face and partially the hands. However, I noticed that the lights inside make it look like you can see ""bones"" through the inflatable's cloak. Setting this up was really easy, I just needed to make sure that I was able to plug it in and then made sure it was fully staked down. While it's been breezy off and on, I have yet to have any issues with this inflatable falling over. When done, I simply unplug and it will deflate on it's own. Really cool decoration and love that it doesn't take up a lot of space on my lawn."
Ronny Acosta,"I wanted something to help cover my comforter but what I didn't expect was this duvet cover to be so fluffy, soft and cozy. After washing and drying this, I found that this helped remove any loose fluff that was still on this cover but even after that, it was still fluffy as ever. Once I tied the corners of my comforter, I found that this made my comforter feel as though I have a weighted blanket on my bed. I have had a weighted blanket before and found that it was that comfortable. However with this cover, it's not only comfortable but I find that I fall asleep a lot faster and don't wake up as often as I used. I now wake up fully rested and not so tired like I used to be. So easy to use and love that I'm able to wash and dry this at home without having to go to a laundromat."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I wanted to get a gazebo/pergola for some time for either our backyard or my parents' for entertaining as part of a yard refresh. We wanted something that had a retractable top because our area gets heavy winds during parts of the year. The gazebo arrived in one long box and will need two people to move around. The box arrived in good condition and had light, exterior damage. Each piece inside the box was wrapped in either plastic or foam and none of the individual pieces had damage or scratches. The instructions were very basic and crude. It consisted of about 4-5 pages of hand drawing diagrams with only 5 steps and a parts list. If you are pretty handy and do a lot of assembly of furnitures and such, the instructions are more than adequate. Each individual piece is clearly labeled with a parts number that can be matched to the parts list in the drawing. In fact, you may even be able to do the assembly without any instructions at all with a bit of trial and error. However, if the instructions were better and provided more steps, it would save you a bit of time. It took me about 2 hrs to assemble the entire gazebo with almost no help. Parts of the assembly were difficult due to the size of the gazebo, but I was able to get it done with the help of my 9-year-old nephew. The final product was exactly as I expected from the product listing. It’s a nice gazebo with a rugged look. The quality is decent. I would expect it to last at least a few years exposed to the elements. It appears to be made of steel and will likely start to show rust in about a year or two. The canopy is similar to a high-end canvas tent, so it is relatively thick. The weak point will definitely be the plastic rings that hold the canvas to the gazebo and is my biggest concern for this item in general. I have put some thought into it, and think I’ll be able to replace it with shower curtain rings when they do give out. Overall, it is exactly what I was looking for and really finished the refresh of my yard nicely. We now have a great outdoor area where we can entertain friends and family. We have really missed that for the past couple years. "
Ronny Acosta,"I wanted to put some extra lights in the game room/play room and these are absolutely perfect. Wasn't looking for the traditional floor lamp and these are definitely different. When it comes to putting them together, these came with a top and bottom, the covers and pegs. When putting them together, I found that putting the covers in the bottom base first helps keep this from moving around a lot. The pegs/clips help keep the covers in place. Even if they get knocked over, I don't have to worry about this falling apart, bending, cracking, breaking or anything like that. Even with carpeted floors, they are very sturdy. These are definitely kid friendly. The remote and app are really easy to use. These are so light weight, if I want to move them or have one of my kids move them, it's really easy to do. Love the look of these and I don't have to worry about changing a bulb."
Ronny Acosta,"I was looking for some extra padding for my futon/pullout bed but what I wasn't expecting is this to be so comfortable. When this first came in, I did have to take it to the laundromat because it was a bit too big to fit into my washer and dryer. However, this actually helped fluff it out considering that it arrived vacuum sealed and was kind of flat. I put this on my futon/pullout bed and found that I was still able to put my sheets over the original mattress and this one. I then laid on it and it was so comfortable that I didn't want to get out. There have been several occasions that I decided to lay on it and every time it is still comfortable. The fabric on this is really soft and what I love is that the fluff inside, even after washing and drying it, it's still fluffy and comfortable as ever. Even with having some guests over since getting this, they have even found it to be comfortable. I was even able to pull this off and use it for a sleeping mat in our living room for our kids during movie night. This is kind of big and does require to be washed in a big washer and dryer. However, it's worth the trips to the laundromat. Super comfortable and I've fallen asleep without waking up to being sore."
Ronny Acosta,"I was looking for something to use on my front porch that had snowflakes that would be big enough that you could tell what they were and these lights are perfect. I had purchased what I thought would be big enough snowflakes but they were way too small. With these lights, I installed them in the front area of my porch and even when I stand in the street, I can clearly see that these are snowflakes. When it comes to installing these, I have light clips that hook onto my porch and I was able to use these clips with these lights. I do have a plug nearby that these plug into. There is a small button on the inside of the plug that actually changes the way the lights stay on. I can choose either to have this solid, twinkle, flash, go in a wave and so much more. So easy to use and you can tell these are snowflakes."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"I was very, VERY skeptical of these massage guns. They just look dumb. Seriously. I made adult jokes at my friends who bought them. But most of them told me they actually liked it. At first, just two friends. Then I asked 7 and 6 of them had positive things to say. Fine, tried one of their massage guns on my shoulder that pretty much is constantly tense because of my 10+ hours in front of a computer every day with shrugged shoulders (bad posture -- have to catch myself often from doing that!). Initially, I didn't know how to use it. Had the device hit me perpendicular against the shoulder. OUCH! Then I was told to hold it at a slight angle... about 45 degrees. That made a BIG difference. Increased the massage speed and it felt even better! Okay, insert adult joke here too. Bought one for myself and have used it on me and my wife. Works wonders, but you have to make sure you use it correctly and with the correct attachment. Then I bought this smaller one as a gift for my sister-in-law as she's been wanting one too. I had asked her to let me borrow hers once she opened the gift so I could finish writing this review. This one came with several attachments. Be very careful not to use the massager against bone or you could seriously injure yourself! When you get it, charge it fully first. The Massage level goes up to 4 speeds. Battery lasts for about 10 hours, according to the manufacturer. Comparing it to the larger massager that I have, I felt that even though it's VERY light, it doesn't give as strong of a massage. Think of the difference of getting massage by someone very strong and someone weaker. Came with a case. When massaging, do not stay at the same spot for more than 60 seconds and for no more than 3 repetitions to avoid injury. The angle of impact does matter with the different muscle groups. Generally, use the following heads for various body parts:, SHOULDER: ball head, double-clawed head, flat head, UPPER ARMS: ball head, double-clawed head, flat head, CHEST: ball head, WAIST: ball head, double-clawed head, flat head, THIGH: ball head (go top to bottom), CALVES: ball head, bullet head, FOOT FASCIA: bullet head, flat head, BONE JOINTS: cushioned head. My favorite heads are the ball, flat, and cushioned ones. You can see from the above chart that the ball and flat heads are the most versatile. This massager came with: ball, flat, cylindrical bullet, and double-clawed. Enjoy your massage and get the kinks out! Don't get too kinky!"
Ronny Acosta,"I wasn't looking for something too intense and this neck massager is just perfect. I have a small neck injury and when I used my other TENS unit, it caused more issues and more pain. With this one, while it does send shocks to my neck, they're not as intense and painful as my other TENS unit. This feels as though I'm actually getting a massage. Since using this since I got it over a month ago, my neck has been feeling so much better. I have not only cut back on how much pain medications I've taken but I haven't had to go to as many therapy treatments as I used to have to. Applying this is really easy and once I have it in the area I'm needing, I just power it on and turn it up or down to the level I'm needing. With all the different levels and modes I'm able to choose from, I get the relief that I'm wanting and needing."
Ronny Acosta,"I wasn't looking for that fresh out of the dryer warmth, but it would have been nice. However, with this towel warmer, it does keep them warm. While it still is a little warm and sunny outside, I noticed that in the morning, it is still a little chilly and does help when it comes to keeping me warm, especially on a cold, tile floor. This was really easy to setup and install. It did come with everything needed to install too, except for towels. I found that how warm the towel gets kind of depends on the thickness. I have some not so thick towels and some very fluffy and thick towels. I noticed the decent ones, similar to beach towels, those do get nice and toasty. However, some of my thicker towels, they get warm but not as warm as my other ones. I have also noticed that when I put a wet head or regular towel on this, it seems to dry them a lot faster. Will definitely come in handy during the cold winter months."
Ronny Acosta,"I wasn't sure how leak proof these containers were going to be but they really are. Even if they are sitting upside down for a good while, nothing leaks out of any of these containers. I recently used the bigger one to hold a homemade sauce. Even with bouncing around in a box and then ending up being on it's side by the time I stopped, it still didn't leak out and the sauce wasn't that thick either. When it comes to cleaning, I've been able to wash these either by hand or even place them in my dishwasher. The lids I've chosen to hand wash every time as I didn't want to risk them becoming warped in my dishwasher. When it comes to storing, they stack inside of each other which makes it so much easier to store. Great quality and they store a good amount of stuff too."
Ronny Acosta,"I wear a size 10.5 to an 11 and went ahead and ordered the 11/12. I'm glad that I did because not only do these fit, but there is still a little room at the end so my heel doesn't slip off. I do have wide feet and do have to buy wide shoes, normally just a D and these fit in the width area too. As soon as they were delivered, I did try them on and what I love about these slippers is even as I put my foot inside, they were not overly tight. The slippers themselves are really comfortable to wear. Even if I'm just wearing them around the house or if I wear them outside, really comfortable. The rubber soles are great because I'm able to wear them outside without worrying about getting the fabric dirty or damaging them. Not to mention, slip proof when there's water on the ground. Really comfortable and even with wearing them every day since getting these last month, they still are in great condition."
Ronny Acosta,"I wear glasses at work which I'm required to wear a mask. I found that if my mask slips just a little, my glasses immediately fog up which prevents me from seeing, when I need to see. With this spray, I wasn't sure if it would actually work but to my surprise, it really does. Before applying, I cleaned my glasses with my normal cleaner. I then sprayed this on my glasses and used the wipe that it came with. I then turned the hot water on in my bathroom to test this out. Not only did my glasses not fog up while the bathroom filled with fog, but I was able to see. Since getting this, I use this every day and found that only 1 spray on each lens is all that I need. I love that this came with a small bottle that fits inside of my scrub pocket. I did find that since I wear my glasses between 10-12 hours a day, there have been a few times I do have to reapply. The great thing about this stuff, besides that it works, is that it doesn't make my glasses dirty or leaves smudge marks. Great spray and so easy to use."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I wear these shorts for biking and for hiking. They fit me well and as expected (I'm 34 waist), have plenty of pockets to carry my gear, and are stiff and sturdy where I don't have to worry about ripping while out sliding down rocks. With that said, because they are so rigid, they also make you feel a bit warmer around the crotch area since it does not seem to allow sweat to dissipate as easily. Likewise, water drops fall right off and as such should work fine in rain -- up until a certain point where it becomes too damp and drops no longer fall off. Wearing these shorts feel decently good, but I would avoid their use during the hot summer months."
Ronny Acosta,"I work with a lot of wood and resin crafts and this sand paper is so easy to use for those types of crafts. Not only does it help smooth out rough spots but when I want to remove excess resin, stain, paint or really anything, this sandpaper does the trick without tearing, falling apart or leaving a bigger mess than what I'm trying to do. I do have a sanding block that I was able to use with this sandpaper and normally I have an issues with sandpaper tearing along the edges. However, with this sandpaper, it has yet to tear or rip on me when I use my sanding block with it. Really easy to trim if I need to cut the sheets too. Great for using for long periods of time or just for removing some simple scuff marks."
Ronny Acosta,"I'm not able to use my phone for music so this MP3 player really does come in handy. What I love is I don't have to have an actual connection in order to listen to my music. All I have to do is drag and drop my music. This came with almost 6GB of space but after inserting a 32GB memory card, I have way more than enough space for all of my music, PODcasts and even my ebooks. The other thing I love about this is if I want to, I can even upload videos with this MP3 player and actually watch shows and movies. This is very user friendly and is small enough that it fits inside of my pocket without even noticing it. I did end up buying a screen protector for this so I don't scratch the screen as I wanted a glass screen protector. Very long battery life and will last me a full day without it dying."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"In short: this canopy is excellent for a heavy-duty one at this price point. It looks and feels like something that will actually last, but it does not appear that the frame itself is made of solid steel. I have done camping, boondocking/overlanding, and backyard entertaining for over a decade, and most canopies do not fare very well under wind. This one actually held up well in Josha Tree two weekends ago with a dust storm hitting us in the afternoon. I had expected the fabric to rip or the frame to buckle -- but it did not. The wide base feet with the included weight bags held the fort down solid. I have absolutely no trouble at all setting this up and taking it down alone. The trick is to place one corner where you want it, grab the opposite corner, lift, and stretch it into place. Once it is mostly expanded, press upward on the slider until it clicks into place, then click into place all the other corners. After that, you simply lift each leg one at a time. Until I discovered that trick, setting up these metal canopies had always been a pain in the rear even with two people, but try out what I had just described. When you take it down, you do the same thing in reverse. First, lower all four legs, unfasten the corner buttons, grab any one of the legs, lift and walk it toward the opposite leg. The entire tent will simply fold up. After that, bag the tent by swinging the bag behind your back, and applying it by sliding it over the top of your head onto the tent. This effectively guides the bag over the tent so that it can slide down onto the bag unhindered. The whole operation of take down or set up takes me easily less than three minutes moving at a normal pace."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Installation was a breeze and straight-forward. Unscrew the two bolts at the back, replace with this seat, tighten the new bolts, and done. Quiet close feature works well -- no more kids slamming the lid closed and waking everyone up."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Installation was straight-forward and as expected for any towel hangers. Find the stud (I use a strong magnet to locate an existing nail in the wall), level the bar, mark the screw holes, install, lock with the included screw, and good to go."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Instructions ONLY came in Chinese and Japanese. Diagrams are thankfully understandable in any language, and so setup was easy to figure out. I own the $300 Snow Peak Takibi Fire and Grill (ST-032SET) and purchased it for camping, boondocking, or overlanding, but that darn thing is HEAVY. MUCH heavier than I had expected. As a result, I had only used it ONCE. Since that purchase a year ago, I had sort of been eyeing smaller designs that would be more portable (with the understanding that they would not be able to have a fire as big as the Snow Peak.) Well, this CampingMoon one came along. (The brand claims to be focused on outdoor equipment.) It is very small and much, much lighter in weight. How did it go?  The moment you open it up, it did not feel as hefty strong as the Snow Peak, but considering that it is also much cheaper, that was to be expected. There were no chemical smells. Excellent. Setup was easy. Takedown too. Grill is oversized so it wouldn't collapse onto itself. Consider getting a fire pit mat to help protect the ground and to keep ember a bit more in check so you won't cause an accidental fire or burn whatever the grill was placed over. Overall, at $50, this grill is much cheaper, lighter, and convenient to carry around than the $300 Snow Peak that only had found use ONCE."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"It took me a loooong time trying to decide which smart lock to use for our short-term rental. There were so many brands, including established ones like Schlage, Kwikset, and others. I wanted something that was secure from a company that has been around for a while and that could be remotely controlled (like for PIN changes/assignments). Yale was recommended by Google's Nest products. Installation took a while to figure out and understand, but there's an app the instructions ask you to download for step-by-step visuals and audio prompts. Then you download the Yale Access app to configure the rest. The Bluetooth (""Access"") module is inserted into a slot in the lock itself. The WiFi module (""Connector"") is plugged into an AC outlet and, from what I found, should be found in front of the lock and not beside it for better performance. The Door Open/Closed magnetic sensor can be installed into either the door itself or screwed on. I could not figure out how to change the master code from the App after you initially configured it from the lock itself. I bought a used one and the lock sounded an annoying alarm -- figured out later to reset it. The used WiFi Connector module also did not work initially until I moved it onto an outlet opposite of the lock. When I had it next to the lock itself, it did not work. I later also found that only the iOS app version had a WiFi configuration option available -- Android did not. Yale, you did a boo-boo there that frustrated me for nearly an hour trying to troubleshoot on my Samsung phone. With all those issues taken care of, the lock works like a charm. Push the checkmark or hit the touchpad with 3 fingers, and numbers light up. Enter the code and push checkmark to unlock. You can then long-press the checkmark to lock. You can configure the PIN codes and other options through the app. Like, automatic unlock when your Bluetooth phone is in range, and auto lock when you leave. If you put the magnetic sensor into the door, the lock can also sense that the door is either open or closed. This allows you to configure automatic locking of the door if it has been open for too long. It could also notify you if it had been open for too long. History in the app shows who locked/unlocked and with what method (app or keypad). You can remotely unlock a door via WiFi too. Battery life remains to be seen. I have not yet integrated it with AirBnB/HomeAway, but the promise made by the product description is that it can integrate with those services to automatically assign and unassign PINs to guests based on their booking schedules. Nice! I like the Silver look over the others."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"It's cute, bastes as intended, and is easy to clean... like other silicone brushes. The biggest difference? This one is cute. Whether it's worth the extra price premium is up to you."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I've been using covers for decades now. Used to heat up my food with plastic wrap, but considering how bad plastic can be for your health, I switched to damp paper sheets for some time. That costed me a lot of money over the years. I eventually got one of these types of silicone covers and game changer as in, saving money. I ordered a pair of these for my parents and our vacation home to keep the microwave cleaner. They collapse for storage and clean as easily as any silicone accessory. Colors are nice and I do not expect them to fade."
Ronny Acosta,"I've been using this binder to not only help organize when it comes to doing my bills, but also when I go shopping. I will bring my reusable totes inside 1 big reusable tote and this binder fits inside perfectly. Inside of the locking envelopes, I'm not only able to keep gift cards that I might have for that store or ones that I get back from purchasing special items, but I'm also able to keep my coupons inside. I will actually use this as my wallet when I go to the store rather than bringing my own sometimes. This binder holds so much without making the binder itself bulky. The other reason I use this binder is to keep track of my bills. I'm not only able to see what is due or coming up, but I'm able to see how much I have leftover to spend and so on. Really great and keeping track of my money so much better than scraps of paper that I constantly lose. Plus it's great at holding receipts I need to keep for whatever reasons."
Ronny Acosta,"I've been using this container to use for fresh fruit and not only is it really easy to use but it allows me to have fresh fruit for about a week. Normally, I only have a few days, if I'm lucky, to eat the fresh fruit that I buy. Since getting this container, I'm able to keep fresh fruit fresh for about a week or so. The size of the container has been the perfect size for me for when I want to take this to work to snack on a healthy option. Rather than only have at least 2-3 days, the longest that I've had fresh fruit before it went bad was 8 days. I have even used this for a homemade salad. When it comes to cleaning, I just hand wash this and done. When it comes to using, the pump on this secures the lid so tight, that even with this moving around in my lunch bag, it doesn't come loose. Not to mention, it sucks all the air out so everything lasts so much longer."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"I've used these ONE time in mud and it worked great! My AWD Toyota Highlander Sport came out without a problem. Second time around, I used it for fun on deep snow to see whether it could get out -- it did, though it required a little bit of shoveling, pushing, re-positioning, and partially breaking the ice underneath. Third time, I tested it on mud again, but noticed the board started cracking and breaking into pieces. You get what you pay for. Keep in mind that most people who use traction boards for the first time will gently press the gas pedal and then floor it harder when they see no movement. This can be very, VERY dangerous as the board could now fly out from underneath the spinning tires and potentially hurt or kill someone behind. So, NEVER EVER stand behind the board as you try to get yourself unstuck. Always push the gas gently, and if it does not work, dig and re-position the board closer and try again... GENTLY. Pushing the car helps a bit, but that's risky and should always be done well clear from the boards. I usually try to push from the middle frame that separates the front and rear passenger doors. These boards look HUGE, but they are actually a bit smaller than the other ones I have seen that work far better and cost way more too."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Knives are an art form. The balance, feel, and ability to cut with smooth strokes can make a difference when all you do is chop day in and day out. Thankfully, that is no longer my dad's job as a former chef. He has always preferred Shun ones because of their shows craftsmanship, beauty, balance, and strength, qualities that the Japanese value very much in their work. I am by no means a knife expert, but when Shun knives have lasted him for such a long time and still cut very well, yet retain their beauty and unique look, it makes me a happy (amateur) cook! So, dad gave this cleaver a try. His immediate comment was that it felt good to grip and had a hefty, quality feel. Then he noted that the knife did not arrive sharp, and he immediately went to sharpen it. After that, he went off to cut and chop a chicken, duck, roast pork, and some raw meats and veggies. End result? He said, ""It's not bad. Not my favorite."" I told him that it costs $39, to which he muttered, ""Yeah, I can tell."" For the price, he said it works fine, but he wouldn't use it in his kitchen if he were to work at a restaurant again."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Leg gaiters - many of my friends do not know what they are for nor their value they add for any backcountry wilderness hiker. Gaiters not only help keep your legs dry in the rain, they also keep out dirt, mud, snow, and just as importantly... Bugs. Like disease-causing ticks. When we go trekking/backpacking, one of the somewhat uncomfortable things is to find your calves completely covered in dirt and dust. Some may say that you can tuck your pants into your boots, which I had been doing for years, but when it came to rain or snow, we would sometimes find ourselves wet. In come the gaiters to solve the issue of rain and snow dripping into your shoes. They truly are wonderful! Solid material, Waterproof, Easy to put on and I am not a gaiter expert and hardly have anything negative to say about them. Practically every gaiter is recommended as long as it stays reliable during prolonged use. Gaiters that make it difficult to keep your leg breathable would not be recommended either. Get yourself a gaiter and have a happier hike."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Look, I get it. You could put yourself something like this for less. Why don't you then, right? With that said, if you prefer to just buy a bunch of them to give out, this set is decent: has a nice select of goodies and the drawstring bag provides a nice touch. Personally, I'd just put together my own gift bag by enlisting my kids as helpers for a weekend project."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Looks very simple and clean and lends to a minimalist look in the bathroom. Scales as expected. Wish it had some sort of memory function that could tell you your past, few weights to help you keep track of your trend, but alas, this is not a smart scale or WiFi enabled one. Those cost considerably more. For a simple, inexpensive scale, this does exactly what it was made for."
Outdoor Enthusiast,Made skin less dry and much more bearable in cold weather where skin tends to start cracking. That resulted in less irritation/itching and bleeding. It does give a small amount of pleasant scent.

Outdoor Enthusiast,"Material is nice and light. Mesh at top allows heat to escape from the head where most heat escapes from the body. The neck flap can be rolled and tucked away underneath the rear brim. Fits my son's 6-year-old head well. It looks really nice, actually."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Material is nice and light. Mesh at top allows heat to escape from the head where most heat escapes from the body. The neck flap with face mesh is a nice touch to keep mosquitoes away without getting too hot while hiking. The flap is removable, though I wish there was a way to tuck it underneath the hat too for easier access. Overall, a good hat with far better pricing than what I was able to find at the local sports stores."
Ronny Acosta,"My 7 year old has recently gotten into bows and arrows and while we have taken them to practice with a real bow and arrow, we bought this for them to practice at home. The quality of the bow is not only a great toy but has actually helped them with holding it properly. The bow itself really does shoot the soft bullets and arrows that it comes with. We ended up taking some old boxes and drew a target on it as this one doesn't come with a target to practice on. However, we found that even though these arrows/bullets don't go through the boxes, they still actually hit them pretty hard. The bow itself was really easy to setup and once set up, they were able to shoot them with no problems. While these do hurt when hit at, this also depends on how far back they are pulled and where they hit. However, this is a lot of fun as I tried it myself."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My baby had been waking up at night curling her legs to pass gas. She appeared uncomfortable and then got cranky from the constant sleep disruption. To help her from having so much gas, my wife switched her to these Avent anti-colic bottles.

The set comes with three 4-oz bottles and one 9-oz bottle. The three bottles come with size 1 nipples and the larger bottle with a size 2. Since our daughter was only two months old when we got this set, she drank from the small bottles with the size 1 nipples. We tried size 2, but the milk flow was too fast for her and milk would spill to the side. In the past, we had only used Dr. Brown anti-colic bottles. We always had problems with those bottles because they leaked everywhere and were a pain to wash with all the different parts with small openings. Compared to Dr. Brown, these bottles have less parts to wash. There is only one piece (the green valve) that you have to insert before putting on the nipple. The valve releases the air bubbles when our baby drinks her milk. This part does not detach to separate smaller pieces like the ones in the Dr. Brown bottles. The valve can also be cleaned easily with the brush that was included in the package for these bottles. We’ve put these bottles in the top dishwasher rack to clean and they still work well. I have not experienced any leakage so far. After using these bottles for a few months and seeing our girl passing less gas, she had been more comfortable at night. She still has gas issues, but not as frequent as before. These bottles may have helped relieve some of the gas issues during milk intake. This is interesting because in the past, we did not like Philips Avent and switched to Dr. Brown's, but with this kit, we went back to Philips."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My copy of Smokin' Southern BBQ arrived last weekend! What a great cookbook! It is a fusion of spice, ideas, techniques, and inspiration. It is a book filled with some old secrets of Southern BBQ and adventurous sauces and sides for the modern cook. The book is extremely helpful for the average person who doesn’t know all of the cuts of meats and doesn’t feel like they have time to spend in the meat market asking the butcher numerous questions about types of meat, how to cook it, and where to find it. Glenn Connaughton does a masterful job of explaining all of this: he is a born teacher with a drooling audience. These recipes are exciting and easy. We just needed the explanation so that we could have confidence at the grill! Glenn is an inspiring teacher! Grilling fish and anything past steak, chicken, and hamburgers didn’t happen in our backyard -- we stayed with what we knew how to do. We no longer need to eat out to have delicious, adventurous, and easy ribs and roasts. What an inspiration! The book has breathed new life into our kitchen and grill and it has become my “go to” gift - no better gift than good food shared between family and friends!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My dad had heard from many people that they had significant improvement using patches like these, but then online reviews also said they were a hoax. He decided to try it anyway for several days to see whether it would actually remove anything from his feet or not and whether he would feel better afterwards. Well, nothing happened in the first 24 hours, but after that, you slowly could see more and more things sticking to the pad -- and as a result, less black things on his feet. He did also notice an improvement in his sleep."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My friend and I have been SCUBA diving, body boarding, and kayaking for a combined total of several decades in the cold, Pacific Ocean. We collectively have had a fair amount of experience with wetsuits ranging from $100-$600. The HISEA is the lowest priced full body suit I have ever owned or used, and my review will take that into consideration.

The HISEA is of good quality for its low price and suitable for any of the above-mentioned activities -- assuming the thickness is suitable for that time of year. The 3/2mm neoprene thickness would not be suitable for scuba diving in the fall/winter but would be ideal for kayaking and surfing. The zipper works reasonably well and smoothly without a snag.

Out of the water (without water inside the suit) it is tight, but movement is fairly easy. Once in the water, the suit will expand and the fit is much improved. One thing to note, my friend has the same wetsuit and it fits him a bit tighter than he'd like. If you are near the upper range of the manufacturer's recommended size, I would go with the next bigger size. Overall, I would recommend this suit to those who only need it a few times a year. But for those who are on the water often, I would recommend going with a higher grade (higher priced) wetsuit. TIP Always wash the wetsuit with fresh water whenever you use it in salt water. Ensure it is completely dry before putting away for storage. Ideally, hang the wetsuit on a hanger made for them for drying and storage."
Ronny Acosta,"My last stylus was never accurate when it came to writing, highlighting or really anything on either my tablet, phone or any other touchscreen. With this stylus, not only did it feel more comfortable to hold but when it comes to accuracy, it really is accurate. No matter where I'm writing, when I want to write on or in a certain area, it will write in that area. If I want to highlight a sentence, it will highlight that sentence without me having to move higher or lower than where the sentence is at. When it comes to using, I'm able to use this for almost 2 weeks before having to recharge the stylus itself and this gets used daily for at least 2-4 hours per day. Even if I'm just doodling, this stylus allows me to either do thick or hair thin lines."
Ronny Acosta,"My only complaint about these wind chimes was I did have to move them from where I originally had them because they did not get enough sunlight to charge the panel. If they don't get enough sunlight, the lights themselves either barely light up or don't at all. However, where I have them now, they get roughly about 6-8 hours of sunlight, but that depends on cloud coverage. I found that with this amount of sunlight, when the lights turn on automatically at night, they are super bright and colorful. When we have gotten a breeze, the wooden piece in the middle will hit the metal poles and sound very peacefully. When it hits the lights, it's more of a blunt sound because they are a thick plastic. Even with the amount of sunlight this wind chime gets, the plastic lights are still intact and have shown no signs of cracking or chipping. When light hits the solar panel, the lights will automatically turn off. As soon as it starts to get dark, the lights will automatically turn on."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My rack arrived slightly bent, but I was able to restore it with a crowbar. It did not come in its own packaging, but rather inside a plastic bag inside an Amazon box. There were NO instructions on how to put this together, but I was able to figure it out by simply looking over the product's pictures on the Amazon site. Assembled it in about 30 minutes and feels sturdy. Rack itself says maximum weight was about 200 lbs, but the product description states 110 lbs. I don't like that the items are to be secured with the included, thin rip cord and would have rather seen it come with a spring-loaded metal holder (akin to a mouse trap) to more securely hold items. So, I'll have to carry with me bungee cords to ensure everything stays packed well. It's priced reasonably well, but the lack of instructions and arrival in a slightly bent state dropped the rating from 4 to 3 stars."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My son and I have been stand up paddle boarding since November of last year, and the last two times, he had taken up the courage to stand up and actually start paddling with a kids kayak paddle I had laying around. I was fortunate to see this youth paddle available. It is just shy of 1"" too tall for his height, but that shouldn't be a problem for too long since kids grow up fast. He used it last weekend and well -- he initially had lost some balance due to the paddle being larger than what he used before, but over time, he got the hang of it and is now able to more efficiently propel us forward -- sort of. He'll get the coordination down eventually. Paddle is made up of 3 parts and floats. If yours does not float, you may want to attach a swim noodle by near the blade to keep it floating longer before it sinks. Blade is curved a bit more than what I am used to seeing with recreational iSUPs, giving it a bit more of a push than normal. Fine with me!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My son and I love to hike and teaching him how to navigate is a fun exercise for him. Granted, the level of accuracy of a compass is important for not getting lost, but since I am around to supervise, it works well enough to teach him the basics. Yes, I realize that I spoke about the compass first for a jacket review. The jacket itself fit my 6-year-old a bit too large, but that means that he can still wear it next year. Quality was surprisingly good, and the ability to remove the hood adds some versatility to how the jacket can be used in relation to ambient temperature and weather conditions. He loves the dinosaur pattern and can name practically any dinosaur there is out there -- all I can do is nod since I don't know how to pronounce many of them myself. Zipper opened and closed effortlessly."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My son had been attending Montessori for the last 3 years and picked up quite an astonishing set of skills. With that said, the school does not do many science experiments, and to me, those are important to do as they help stoke the imagination and raise creativity and interest levels. This book does exactly what I want: easy-to-reproduce science experiments using mostly common, everyday items found around the household and presented in a safe manner. Most importantly, my son wants to try a new experiment nearly every single day, and that has kept him off the tablet and television set. It has also encouraged parent-child interaction and has encouraged him to go outside more often to play and find other ways to apply the science he had learned to the natural environment."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My son has absolutely loved the KiwiCo activities we had purchased a few of especially during the stay-at-home guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic. They helped keep him interested while also encouraging parent-son bonding. This kit was easy to follow (our 5.5-year-old was able to complete most takes alone) and had nearly everything needed. The rest had to be provided with items you probably already have around the house. Overall, a fun, engaging experience for the kids with simple tasks to complete."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My wife loves making spam musubi for when we go out on trips. I, on the other hand, prefer making sushi at home -- either cut rolls or hand rolls. For both purposes, these seaweed sheets hold up well and taste like... seaweed.  ""Premium"", eh? Sure. They are strong and did not flake like some cheap ones we tried long time ago. They tasted good and had a nice, subtle crunch. Worth the cost? If you live near an Asian market -- like Korean, Japanese, or Chinese ones -- similar sets can be had for far less. If you do not live near one, your choices are limited. For what we made these sheets with, these were good. Just too pricey for us since they are cheaper at the local markets."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"My youngest child is nearly 2 years old now. So, this bath tub is not really suitable for my kids any more. What I did get it for was for camping. How so? To wash dishes, fruit and veggies, and transport water -- without taking up the amount of space needed by plastic tubs. Silicone is also known for its anti-bacterial properties, and so that makes cleanup a bit easier. The drain hole is a nice touch, but I really have no need for it except to perhaps use it as a makeshift tank to drip water down through for washing hands or rinsing stuff off. When not camping, we are using it as a laundry basket to keep our kids' dirty clothes in."
Ronny Acosta,"No matter how much adjust this stand, once I have it locked into position, this stand really does hold it's spot. Whether I'm using this with my projector, phone, camera or even my laptop, this stand holds it all. Even if I'm working on my laptop and I'm pressing down on it, the stand itself has not once dropped down, even with the weight of my arms. This stand comes with a foam piece that fits perfectly underneath and to ensure that our projector doesn't fall over, even if someone taps it, this came with straps to help keep it held down. Even with the foam pad, I found that our projector or laptop has not over heated or get overly warm. When done, this practically folds down to nothing and fits inside of our hallway closet without taking up a lot of space. Very sturdy and easy to use."
Ronny Acosta,"No matter if we use fruit or vegetables, this juicer juices anything and everything. What helps is we just moved into a bigger house that has several fruit trees. Not only am I able to juice those and have fresh juice for any time of the day but when it comes to making different juices in general, I'm able to do so too. We also found that we ended up using some of the juice pulps as fertilizer for those same plants and our other plants. When it comes to cleaning up, depending on how much we juice, sometimes all we have to do is soak the filter in hot soapy water to remove the excess pulp that gets stuck. Overall, this juicer doesn't leak and allows us to use the fruit and vegetable pulp for our plants. Hardly takes up any space on our shelf too."
Ronny Acosta,"No matter what blade I use, each blade is super sharp. The holder itself is really comfortable to hold. I found that when doing bigger projects, I tend to use the knife that has the bigger handle. Not just because it's bigger but because it's so much more comfortable to hold. Plus with bigger projects, the handle allows me to use more pressure without hurting myself. When it comes to smaller projects, the regular handles work just fine. I do a lot of resin projects with a little bit of leather occasionally, but no matter what type of material I'm using, these knives cut through practically anything with no issues. There are even times I don't have to push hard into the material for these knives to cut either. The most convenient thing about this set is that it comes with a box that holds everything in place. No matter how much it gets moved, the extra knives are held in place with a magnet that insures they don't fall either."
Ronny Acosta,"Normally with my old mixer, if I mix dry ingredients, I have to deal with some or a good amount kind of going out of the bowl and all over my mixer. However, with this mixer, I no longer have that problem thanks to the cover on this. Whether I want to use it or not, I'm able to do so because it does come off if I want it off. However, the opening on this still allows me to add any other ingredients while this mixer is on. Whether I'm making a cake, dough or even whipping up some whip cream, nothing ever comes out of the bowl while it's on. Not to mention, even when I'm adding ingredients, I never have to worry about splashing and making a mess. This mixer is really easy to use and so much more quieter than my old mixer. Everything is easy to take apart and clean too. Really strong mixer and stays stuck on my counters."
Ronny Acosta,"Not only are these brushes great for traveling, because they are small enough and hardly take up any space but when it comes to removing dirt and anything else, these brushes get it out. What I love about these brushes is I don't have to press in too hard and they don't tear up my cuticles while brushing my nails. Whether I'm getting dirt from gardening or just cleaning up my nails after filing, these brushes get it all out. The handles are really comfortable too. I'm actually able to put a couple of fingers inside which I didn't think was going to hold them, but they really do hold it in place without it slipping out. Whether I'm using cleaner, soap or just water, these brushes get all of the debris out without damaging my fingers or cutting my cuticles."
Ronny Acosta,"Not only does this clean my teeth, but the battery life on this lasts a very long time. I use this roughly 2-3 times per week and what I love is how easy it is to use. While I still go to the dentist, I found that this helps with those in between visits. I don't need this to be used all the way up in order for it to remove plaque, but I don't have a lot of plaque build-up. When it comes to using, I'm able to use my phone to get a close up of what is going on behind my teeth and a closer view of the front of my teeth. Using this is really easy but I did make sure to read the instructions that this came with before using. I recently had a dentist appointment for a teeth cleaning and was told that I hardly had anything on my teeth and was in and out in no time. Easy to clean and disinfect too."
Ronny Acosta,"Not only does this use less grease and is a lot more healthier for my family. When it comes to using, this not only is easy to use but I'm able to feed my whole family all at the same time. I bought this to replace a smaller air fryer that would require me to only cook half a meal at a time. With this size, I'm able to cook my family whole meals without having to cook two of the same meals. I saw that it had advertised to cook a whole chicken so I did just that. I was not only able to cook a whole chicken but it came out crunchy and flavorful. The meat inside was not dried out but moist. No matter what I have put in this air fryer, all of my food has come out delicious. The thing that did surprise me with this air fryer is its really easy to clean too. Really easy to use and am able to store this really anywhere in my cabinets or leave it on my counter."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Note the size of these patches... 3.15"" (8cm) and exactly the same as the ones that came with several of my inflatable stand up paddle boards (iSUPs) from different manufacturers. I would not get larger sized D-Ring patches except for inflatable kayaks and boats. Adding these patches onto an inflatable is not very difficult. In fact, I had done it a few times since trying to figure out the best way of doing so not too long ago. First and foremost, I was disappointed to find that there were NO instructions or videos available on the Internet that showed how to attach D-Rings to an iSUP where a foam deck was in the way. Some said to just glue them onto the deck, but personally, I find that to NOT be a good idea as I do not find it to make a very secure hold. Instead, I recommend to attach the D-Rings to the PVC itself for a stronger bond. There is an article available on the web with step-by-step instructions and photos by searching for ""yuenx convert isup to kayak"". Gluing the PVC D-Rings is easy. Here are the general steps: Unroll the dry, clean, deflated kayak. Apply PVC glue to where you want the D-Rings to be, and let it sit for 30 secs until tacky. Once the glue is gummy, press on the D-Ring, and smooth out any wrinkles in the patch. Weigh down the patch or clamp it down. Let dry for 24 hours before inflating the kayak. "
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Okay, so, a garden hose is to be used for gardening, right? Well, we used this to pretend-play to be a fireman. Our son loves playing with it, complete in his fireman outfit and imaginary fire that he finds all over the backyard. It outputs a spray powerful enough to knock over light items. It can also be as gentle as a mist."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"On our recent weekend trip to the outskirts of Sequoia National Park, we camped on dispersed land. It was over 100F, mind you, and setting up camp on dry, sandy land was not something I was looking forward to. Having to watch the kids at the same time in all that heat while unloading and setting up was also quite frustrating, and so the first thing I did was set up this slackline between two, solid trees (with the protector on, of course). I set one side up at about 6' and the other at about 4-5 feet. Watching the company's How-To video (and others I found on YouTube) helped a lot. Next, I attached a Ninja obstacle course kit, including a Yamiprobi Ninja Slider made for 3"" slacklines, and turned it into a zipline for kids! The slackline itself is 3"" wide. Suffice to say, the kids had a BLAST for hours and we had to keep reminding them to rehydrate. We also had adults (ranging between 110 - 190lbs) try the zipline, and though the slackline sagged a few inches more, we were able to ride it just fine. Overall, we were quite happy with the zipline idea. It really helped us keep the kids entertained while the adults attended to setting up camp, cooking, and cleanup in the horrid heat."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"One of my absolute, favorite gears to bring with me to the outdoors. Consuming only 4W in Warm or Cold White (5W in Natural) color, its bright/warm light can bring a pleasant ambiance to the campsite. It lit up a large area and can be hung off nearly anywhere: a tree branch, car, tent, rope, and so on, by attaching a carabiner and to the loop found at the base of the bulb. The built-in light switch has its Power button glow a soft blue to make it easier to find in the dark, and to turn the bulb on/off without having to connect/disconnect the cable from a USB port. A 50Wh battery bank, for example, can power this light bulb for roughly 10 hours (50Wh / 5W). On a 3-night camping trip, it consumed only about 50% of a 220Wh battery power station!

Outdoor Enthusiast,"One of my nephews had been attending Montessori for the last 3 years and picked up quite an astonishing set of skills. With that said, the school does not have programs geared towards autistic children, and so his parents had augmented his education with external therapy instead. I gave them this book to see whether it could help their son with building confidence and concentration. They looked through it and said that many of the concepts and activities were actually recommended by his therapists, and so I tried some of them on my son too to see if it would help him build better confidence in general. He enjoyed the activities and actually communicated a bit better too. So, the book seems to also help those who are not autistic."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"One of the children I know goes to Occupational Therapy to ""help with barriers that affect a person's emotional, social, and physical need."" One such barrier was with attention and time management, and one of the tools recommended was a visual timer such as this. Its purpose is to tick very silently to provide a small amount of stimulation, but to also establish a little rhythm with which to help the person to concentrate. The visual portion is to give them a -- well, visual -- way to see how much time is left for the task (which were usually no more than 2 minutes long for the one, young kid I know -- with durations getting extended as the child was able to hold attention better). A digital countdown timer would not help as young children do not yet have the same sense of time as adults when seeing numbers decreasing to zero. Has it helped the kid? Yes and no. Initially, it was a nice novelty for him and he did pretty good. He later started losing focus again, but with weekly therapy, his therapist was able to get him to concentrate for longer periods of time without intervention. He has now been able to sit and finish his 10-minute work with a reward he could enjoy later: playing with the kitchen (yep, that boy likes to cook!) Can this be used as an alarm clock? Sure, but I believe that to be a big stretch. It works better for what the therapist said to use it for."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Our family uses this pack for two things: Icing an area in preparation for painless medical injection. Heating an area for muscle relief. To freeze, process is self explanatory. To heat, microwave only for a few seconds -- go over, and you could potentially rupture the pack."
Ronny Acosta,"Our last toaster said it was supposed to fit bagels but no matter what, we would either have to smoosh our bagels in order for them to fit down the toaster or worry about them not popping up and cutting them up just trying to remove them. With this toaster, that has not been the case. Not only does it fit our bagels but even if they are not perfectly smooth, they still pop out with no problems. What I love is that this is really easy to use, whether you are using fresh or even frozen. When I'm needing to defrost any breads or even waffles, I just press the defrost button, set it to the number that I want and done. Since getting and using this toaster, since it was delivered, no matter what we have toasted this toaster has made everything come out perfect. We even tried the toaster bags that make grilled cheese sandwiches and we didn't have to worry about the bags getting stuck or catching on fire. Overall, great toaster that will either lightly toast or gives us really toasted foods."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Our studio's business has expanded a bit and we purchased an additional set. Our original review for the 2-pack is the same as for this 3-pack. I had been a professional photographer since 2008 and retired six years ago to focus on being as good of a father to my children as possible. That did not mean hanging up my cameras. I still use them to photograph my kids as they grew through the years. Towards the end of my photography career, I traded my bulb/umbrella setup for a RGB LED based lighting system instead, primarily for the lighter weight, more compact size, and battery portability. As a bonus, I liked the ability to control the lights via a Bluetooth-connected smartphone app without having to interrupt my shoots with the infant/toddler kids. RGB LED lights allow you to simulate and color-correct certain lighting conditions. From cool daylight (5600 Kelvin) to warm sunsets (3200K) and control over the intensity, hue, and saturation of the lights, the variety of scenes you could use this light kit with is quite open ended. The trick, as always with photography or videography, is to understand how light works and to use that to your advantage. The GVM 1200D is a very nice upgrade over its predecessor with over 3.5x the number of RGB LEDs, providing more consistent, smooth control of the intensity, color, hue/saturation of the produced light. A built-in diffuser helps cast softer shadows and make skin look more flattering on the subjects. Like its older model, the lights can be set as Master and Slaves so all the lights can be controlled together through the Bluetooth-connected ""GVM LED"" app (available on both iOS and Android). It also has the same amount of ""lighting scenes"" (8) that are activated through the app, though their use cases are limited to special occasions. The new, red-colored coating of the aluminum frame makes it stand out (compared to the black of its predecessor), and that could potentially cause a small, red color cast on the subject in certain shooting situations. I would have preferred that GVM kept everything black, but this is just a minor concern. 60W AC adapters power the lights, while the LEDs themselves are rated to output 50W (up from 40W of previous models). They can also be battery operated with Sony F750/970 batteries (not included) for on-location shoots anywhere outside for that perfect, low-light shot or video footage. Brightness, according to GVM, is rated at 22,000 lux at 0.5m (1.6') or 7,300 lux at 1m (3.3'). What does that mean? Lux is the intensity of light at a specific location away from the source. The farther away you travel, the lower the Lux rating, whereas the Lumen (light intensity) remains unchanged. In other words, these lights produce an intense amount of luminosity that can produce enough to fill an entire room. The lights' panels direct where the light should go and also help minimize spill onto the surrounding. Impressive still is the lifetime warranty with a 3-year, full refund guarantee. That is just unheard of and shows that the company had been standing behind its products (and why I had been a fan of GVM for years. The light stands fold relatively compact and are quick to deploy. The light frames can be mounted to the stands in two ways to accommodate different lighting angles. When you finish a shoot, be sure you always turn off the lights. You do not want to leave them on and accidentally cause a fire."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Pellet smokers can accumulate enough pellet dust to make the auger get stuck or spark a fire. Sifting pellets to get rid of the fine dust helps tremendously in keeping the auger happy. Cup feels solid and well-made. It sifts flour well too, but again, I use it for my pellet smoker."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"Perhaps these chains were made to hold keys, but I actually use it for many different things -- mostly for camping/outdoorsy things. For instance, holding my badge securely on my pants, lights on ropes, securing my ski pass to my jacket, etc. They are nice alternatives to carabiners. But of course, these work well as key chains too."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Putting the ingredients together is as straight-forward as expected. The end result: tastes similar to falafel but is a bit more bland than the veggie burgers I am used to. With that said, that is a good thing because that allows you to season the patty to your liking. I would rather have that than a patty that is overly salty. Texture wise, it has a nice crunch while retaining a juicy, moist interior. Not bad at all of a burger."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Quality wise, these stickers work as expected. They stayed on and felt solid. What do we use them for? To put a smile on someone's face. As a ""Thank you"", to reward a child for completing a task, or to just tape it on someone and watch them light up. I wish these were yellow, but the shiny, silver surface causes it to turn into a rainbow of colors under the sun. Neat."
Ronny Acosta,"Rather than being left with overdried, frizzy hair, after using this hair dryer, I'm left with soft and bouncy hair. Even while I'm styling my hair with my old hair dryer, my hair will still look dried out and frizzy, especially if I try and straighten it. With this blow dryer, not matter if I'm straightening, styling, curling, drying my natural waves or just drying my hair, I'm always left with healthy looking hair. The hair dryer itself is really easy to use. To power on, just press the rotating arrow button. This will also allow you to turn it on to heat or cool. Once on, you can press the + or the - button and this will raise or lower the temperature. When it comes to adding the accessories, I just push on or pull off. This hair dryer is really light weight but more importantly leaves my hair looking and feeling soft and healthy."
Ronny Acosta,"Rather than being stuck with a heating pad that has an extremely short cord and can only be used where there's a plug, this thing can go anywhere. The strap is elastic and works with almost any waist size. Meaning, I can use this and then I can give this to my daughter who has a smaller waist and she's able to adjust it to her size and it fits her too. The strap itself is fully adjust but love that it is elastic which gives you that extra stretch so it's not too tight. The pad itself has 3 different heat settings and found that for me, the high setting is a bit too much for me. However, I've put this on my abdominal area and back and I absolutely love it. The size of it is perfect and isn't too big or too small. It completely covers where I'm wanting it and really does offer that heating relief that I'm needing. The vibration helps with my lower back and again, has 3 different settings. This thing is fully rechargeable but even on a single charge, it really does last a long time before it needs to be recharged."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Rinse, hang loop around your neck (preferably on backpack within arm's reach instead -- I always get paranoid that I might get hung by the lanyard if the whistle gets caught against the tree while running) and have it ready to use in case of an emergency. Whistles loud and distinctively, but not as loud as my Windstorm. Does not rust. My son and I each keep one with our life jackets when out paddle boarding."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Seriously, what are car dealerships thinking? Wife brought in her car for an oil change and to have it looked at because a cover came off. Dealer said he would have the cover looked at for no cost and would have it fixed free. She was missing 2 retainer clips (I had already told her that, but just had no extras available to re-attach myself.) If the dealer charged more than $5, say no to the repair.

Her oil change was completed and then there was a $50 charge for the ""repair"" of the cover. She told the new shift worker to take off the charge and to take back the 2 retainer clips they added. He refused because the original service person was off for the day. Next day, I went back to the dealership with her and demanded the charge to be removed because we were never quoted the cost before the ""repair"" would be done. It was ""unauthorized work"". They obliged. I grabbed myself a pack of these retainer clips off Amazon. Attached them to the loose cover. Perfect fix... for pennies. Save yourself $50 and just buy yourself a bag of extra retainer clips for much less."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"She decided to upgrade to this hard shell case. The case is sturdy and thick. She has dropped her phone a few times and the case still looks new.  I can't attest to the longevity of the case since she hasn't had it as long as the last one.  The color option for this phone is nice to her, but it is not as sleek and thin as she hoped it would be.  Overall, it does the job in keeping the phone from being damaged, but the design could be a little thinner.  Also, the hard shell does not provide any grip -- so it could slip out of her hand."

Ronny Acosta,"Since getting this set almost a month ago, I've been able to change my colors almost weekly. The one thing I love about these polishes is that it comes with everything, but the UV/LED nail lamp which I have. I do have gel polish remover that helps peel the paint off a lot faster and it comes off with no problems. I am always washing and doing stuff with my hands but not matter what I do, this polish doesn't chip or peel easily. I always lightly scuff my nails before applying the base coat, color and then top. With these colors, depending on which one I'm using, I can either just put 1 or 2 coats of colors on to get the desired look. Usually on my pinky fingers I only need one coat of polish. These are not watery thin polishes but fairly thick that allow me to only need 1 coat on some of the not so dark colors. They dry really easily under my lamp and usually only need about 60-90 seconds of drying time. So many colors and great quality polish."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Since we have young kids, our phones can take a bit of beating from time to time. My wife normally prefers the silicone cases since they are thin and prevent the phone from easily slipping out of her hand. The last silicone case she purchased lasted merely 3 months before the edges wore off and could no longer provide the protection she needed.  Another drop and her phone may need to be replaced. She decided to upgrade to this hard shell case. The case is sturdy and thick. She has dropped her phone a few times and the case still looks new.  I can't attest to the longevity of the case since she hasn't had it as long as the last one.  The color option for this phone is nice to her, but it is not as sleek and thin as she hoped it would be.  Overall, it does the job in keeping the phone from being damaged, but the design could be a little thinner.  Also, the hard shell does not provide any grip -- so it could slip out of her hand."
Ronny Acosta,"So after using this almost immediately after it was delivered, I noticed that my hair was shiny and bouncy. To show a before and after, I washed my hair and used my old blow dryer. Afterwards, my hair looked fried, frizzy and had no bounce to it. Not to mention, even with using conditioner, my hair was full of tangles. I then rewashed my hair the same way I did the first time but I used this blow dryer. Afterwards, my hair was so much easier to brush but more importantly, my hair didn't look fried, frizzy and had bounce to it. I have been using this blow dryer since and love how my hair looks after using. This blow dryer folds down and hardly takes up any space in my drawer. Even when it comes to traveling, I take this blow dryer with me. Really easy to use and the attachments really do help me when it comes to styling. Best part, my hair looks so much healthier and I haven't changed any of my hair routine."
Ronny Acosta,"So first off, these are the smaller sized flashlights that do require batteries. The great thing about these is they do come with the batteries which made it so much easier when it came to testing these out. All of the batteries that came with these flashlights all work and the flashlights did turn on. I bought these as party favors for my kid's birthday party. What I didn't think was that they would be such a great hit. The kids not only loved them but ended up playing flashlight tag and a bunch of other games. We did keep one for us and not only is it handy to have but the flashlight really is bright. I needed one to look in our attic because the light went out and not only was I able to see everything, but this flashlight practically lit up our whole attic. Even though it's small, don't let the size of this flashlight fool you."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"So, I bought this to balance 2 eggs on top of one another. One cooked, one raw. It's such a challenge. I am not sure how this thing is supposed to hold eggs. I then put all 4 together to see whether I could balance a 5th in the middle. It worked! Wow. Amazing! Good thing the ceramic feels and looks great. Eventually, I figured out how to balance 2 eggs on top of one of the cups: punch open the cooked egg at the top, dig a small hole into the egg, then place the raw one on top. Tada! Balanced. I feel so proud of myself. Next challenge: trying to get 2 eggs balanced on each of the cups, then having them all stack up in an 8-egg tower formation. UPDATE 10 secs after writing this review: I realized I used this product wrong the entire time! It's not a toy, but rather should be used to hold eggs in place for eating. But that doesn't seem to work either. That Ostrich egg just won't stay put. I don't get it..."
Outdoor Enthusiast,Stakes arrived in good condition. Will probably last one season outside if not coated. Fun to paint and decorate giving my backyard garden a more upbeat feel.
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Starting seeds with these is easy. Transplanting is also simple: cut them into the appropriate size and put into the ground. The tray supposedly will biodegrade and become nutrients to feed the plant with. I am not sure how long that process will take, and so when I put them into the ground, I actually cut the tray walls and lay them into the ground so the roots can continue growing outwards. These trays remind me of egg cartons..."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Stools help you poop better. Not many people know this. They lift your legs up a bit, opening up your bottom to an optimal angle for logs to fall through. Never felt better chucking as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Tasty. Sweet Habanero one reminds me of a Vietnamese jerky I like. Texture is not hard -- I prefer softer, chewy jerky. Both the Original and Sweet Habanero were not overly salty. Pricing is in line with other jerky of similar quality, though a bit more expensive than buying at a brick and mortar store. But then again, I could not find these in any local stores."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"The bag fits the 893 Deluxe version perfectly. As a result, it should also work for the 19"" Basic and Premium versions as they share the same dimensions. A bag helps with carrying the Outland Firebowl, keeps the car clean, and holds all content inside. It also helps protect the Firebowl against the environmental effects, dirt, moisture, etc.The material was pleasantly well-made, and the front, zippered pouch is generously large. It is a lot better than the DnxHone-made one I previously bought for the 893 Deluxe. Priced much lower at $28 vs $37 for the official bag. The official bag is better-padded, however."
Ronny Acosta,"The best thing about this fan, besides that it really does help cool a room, is the fact that there are no pesky light bulbs. Where this fan is installed, it is just over 20 feet high from our floor so having to change light bulbs is a real pain. However, with this fan, I no longer have to do that. The light on this has 3 different settings and depending on the time of day, kind of helps determine which setting to put this on. I did find that at night, we mainly use the bright white. The fan blades do have some weight to them but found the curve in them actually helps with pushing more air around the room. Since installing this in our stuffy den, the room has not only been cooler but we no longer are turning the AC up. The remote is definitely a plus as again, the fan is really high and trying to turn this on and off would be tricky. Even from being around the corner, with this remote, I'm still able to not only turn the fan on but even the lights. The range on the remote to the fan is very good and doesn't require you to be right in front of it. For me, this was really easy to install as I installed all of our fans in our home. For the price, not only does it cool our room a lot better but its energy efficient."
Ronny Acosta,"The blanket itself is not only perfect for what I needed it for but the size and softness is great. Everything I wanted to say is exactly on this blanket. Not to mention, our favorite movie is Up, which this blanket features the main characters on the blanket. The blanket is really soft and not only fits on our bed but can be used really anywhere. I have actually caught my spouse with this on our couch. The blanket is big enough for 2 or even 3 people to share. After I gave this to them, we did wash and dry this in our washer and dryer. We did use warm water and medium heat to dry this. After grabbing it to check, the quality of this blanket still looked brand new, just washed. We have since washed this blanket several times and seems to be the go to blanket that is on our bed. Really does keep you warm too."
Ronny Acosta,"The case that this chainsaw comes with is not only hard but holds everything that comes with this mini chainsaw including an extra battery. When it comes to the chainsaw itself, the blades are really sharp and cuts through branches of all sizes. The weight of this chainsaw is so much lighter than my bigger chainsaw but have found that I prefer to use this one because it's a lot more comfortable to hold, especially when it comes to using. There is a cover that helps protect my eyes from bits and pieces of wood chips that could possibly fly into my eyes. The best thing about this chainsaw is that they batteries last a very long time. Even with using this all day, I still have enough battery life leftover to use for the next time. Really convenient, not to mention, great for cutting firewood while camping."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"The characters are lovable and helps calm a crying, hurting child. I actually used one of them on my son's scraped knee after he fell off his scooter. He instantly calmed down. I also placed some of the bandages onto both my eye lids to tape my eyes shut. Best sleep ever. Whenever I snored, my wife also took a couple strips to tape my nose closed. Best sleep for her ever. One time, the sole of one of my shoes came off. No worries! Spongebob to the rescue! Slapped one of them on my finger and instantly the shoe felt good to walk in again. Amazing!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"The easiest way to start fishing is pan-fishing as they are small and very easy to catch. Lighter rods are best used for lighter fish so that you can feel when it bites or nibbles. This rod was easy to use and felt good and in control. Caught some trout and bass with it on two, separate trips, although I felt a small amount of struggle with a 12 pounder where I wished I had my other rod available. Either way, won the fight in the end with patience and persistence."
Outdoor Enthusiast,The Goal Zero Nomad solar panels are heavy and big. I attached these to the grommet holes found on the panels to make carrying far easier. Works great for that. I'm sure this will work for rifles too.
Ronny Acosta,"The great thing about this grill is how easy it is to use, especially when out at my work. Where I work, I'm outside and we've been wanting to do a BBQ but no one wanted to deal with charcoal and we are not allowed to have propane on site. With this grill, we were able to plug this into our outside plugs and still be able to grill. Since getting this, we've been having potlucks every other day or 2. We've been able to grill steaks, chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs, hot links and even a triptip. No matter what we cook, we still get the same grill marks that we would normally get on a traditional grill. When it comes to clean up, we just make sure the grill has time to completely cool off and cleaning is really easy to do. When we are not using it, we're able to store this inside our locker room without it taking up a lot of space. Best part is it's safe to use and we have not had any problems with this falling over or creating an accidental fire. Cooks our food the way we want and we're even able to toast buns on this too."
Ronny Acosta,"The great thing about this knife is not only is the grip really comfortable to hold but found that the hole in the knife is a great place that I can put my finger in. Not only that but I found that when using this on meat that I'm grilling, I'm able to hook this knife on a hook that I have on a tray next to my grill. The knife arrived really sharp which meant I didn't have to sharpen it. After washing, I was able to test this on a tomato that I was going to cut for dinner that day. Not only did it cut through, but it didn't require me to saw the tomato or squish it while cutting it. Even when it comes to cutting through tough meat, it cuts it like melted butter. The knife is really easy to clean but do be careful when removing this from the box because it really is sharp. Great for cutting through fruits, vegetables, meats and even cheeses with no problems."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"The guide helps the tempered glass go onto the S21+ screen perfectly and effortlessly. Once placed, used the included scrubber to push all bubbles out. After a day, the glass has adhered well to the phone and fits well within the Spigen case. Gliding my fingers across the glass is smooth. The only caveat is that fingerprint reader no longer works despite turning on Touch Sensitivity in the settings."
Ronny Acosta,"The knife itself is very sharp. It was even delivered already sharpened, however since it was inside a very well padded box and had blade covers on it, I didn't have to worry about possibly cutting myself when it was delivered. However, what I did find out about this knife is that it cuts through some of the toughest meat like melted butter. With cheese it was a little more difficult because there were no divots. However, I'm also able to cut through all sorts of fruits and vegetables without feeling as though I was sawing through them. The handle has a really nice and strong grip to it. Even though it is kind of smooth, I have not once found that it slipped through my hand while cutting anything. Great blade and really easy to clean and store away."
Ronny Acosta,"The one thing I love about this sweater is how comfortable and cozy this sweater is. Even when this was first delivered, I tried it on and even before washing and drying this, the sweater itself is really soft. After washing and drying this sweater, the sweater itself is not only soft but the craftsmanship of the sweater it still looks great. Nothing has come undone or shown signs of this sweater starting to come undone. I don't care for sweaters that come up to my neck and this sweater is absolutely perfect. At first glance, this doesn't look like it would keep you warm but it actually does. I do recommend wearing something underneath as there are some times that you can see through this. Really comfortable and love that I can either wear this sweater casually or dress it up."
Ronny Acosta,"The one thing I was really surprised about this couch caddy was how sturdy it really is. I had an old on that would always slip and slide off. With this, I don't have that issue. The other thing that I love about this, is the side that goes inside between the cushion and the couch really does stay in place. The tray part comes off which I found to be helpful when it came to putting this on my couch. It really does hold drinks and really anything I put on top of it. Even with getting up, it still stays on the tray. The pockets on the side not only fit my remotes, I have 3 different sizes but I also found that depending on the phone, I'm able to put it inside the pocket when I'm charging it. Since using this, I'm showing no signs of warping or tearing."
Ronny Acosta,"The only down side of this shirt is you do need to order a size up. Other than that, this shirt fits great. I did order a size up and I am so glad I did. I went off of the measurements and even though I was close to the XL, I decided to order the XXL and it fits perfectly. I don't like my shirts too tight and the XL would have been too tight for comfort. The fabric on this is really soft and even though I've washed it several times, the lettering on this shirt has not cracked or peeled. Even with wearing this several times, the lettering still looks great and still not cracking or even coming close to it. I do wash this in my washer but choose to hang dry. Even with doing so, this shirt still looks and feels great on. Even the stitching is still all in tact and I've worn this shirt several times now."
Ronny Acosta,"The only reason why I gave this 4 stars is that I had to buy an adapter for this headset in order to plug it into my phone and there is no mute button on the headset. For me, those are the cons. The pros about this headset is the clear sound that comes through. The headset itself is fully adjustable with really comfortable padding that doesn't hurt my ears, especially when worn for long periods of time. The mic on this headset also moves. There have been times I've spoken to people who either put me on speaker or are hard of hearing and moving this closer to my mouth helps with them being able to hear me better. Other than those bumps, I don't have any problems with people hearing me. This has not only helped with bending my neck awkwardly all of the time, but I'm able to get my job done a lot faster without fumbling with a phone. Really great headset and clear sound."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"The Pimax Vision was introduced as a Kickstarter project in late 2017. Its promise was to outdo the competition with a crazy-high 8K resolution that would make even the smallest text legible. Delays after delays, it finally achieved that goal and debuted with much fanfare in the VR industry with competitors like Oculus and Valve watching from the sidelines. It achieves that 8K detail with two 4K displays and a crazy-wide, 200-degree field-of-view that cannot be described without experiencing it. For comparison, Oculus Quest only has 90 degrees and the Valve Index has 130. What does this mean? Your peripheral vision finally comes into play when playing supported games, watching immersive movies, or yikes -- VR pornography. The media content never looked as lifelike and sharp before. However, this detail comes with a price: you will need a fairly powerful graphics card to power it, such as the $800+ Nvidia RTX 2080 or $2,000+ RTX 3090. Luckily, you can go with a lower-powered card by rendering content at 1440p per eye, then upscale it to 4K. I did just that with the Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti. This then brings it in line with Oculus and other, higher-end headsets but again, with one notable advantage: that marvelous, 200 degree field of view that can help ease the feeling of claustrophobia for some! Note: the image clarity will partially depend on your graphics cards. The more powerful it is, the more clear the images will be, of course. I liked how light the headset is and its build quality feels strong enough to not easily break on a fall. Yes, I had a couple friends who actually played with VR for their first time and ended up losing their orientation/balance and falling onto the floor. The lenses are larger than usual and as such should be more accommodating for a wider range of eye balls with varying levels of sight. Accessories are available for the Pimax to enhance the VR experience. For instance, headphones are not built-in, though I prefer to have them wireless anyway for increased mobility and freedom of movement. There also is the Comfort Kit that provides an unusually large headset cushion and actually gives the best comfort I have had -- ever -- for a VR system. The Pimax can play both Steam VR and Oculus games via its own software (""PiTool"") and can refresh at up to 90 Hz. My wife and I both really enjoyed playing Beat Saber and Half-Life: Alyx, and I can't wait to play the new Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond when its price comes down. I only wished that Pimax would create a standalone VR headset -- like the Oculus Quest 2 -- that would not require a PC to power its graphics. I would imagine, however, that a large amount of battery would be needed to make that happen. Overall, Pimax delivered on most of its Kickstarter promises, and this will hopefully kick its competitors and established players (looking at you, Oculus/Facebook, Vive/HTC, and Index/Valve!) into high gear to come out with even more impressive VR headsets."
Ronny Acosta,"The quality of these lids made it really easy to do arts and crafts with. I not only got enough to do fall decorations with my class but I'm also able to do Christmas decorations with them too. The lids themselves did need to be scuffed a bit in order for the paint to stay on them, but when it came to scrubbing/scuffing them, it was really easy to do. Even after painting these lids, the paint didn't peel off very easily. I found that I was also able to use a hot glue gun and even a few different craft glues with them. Even when it came to using sealant, it didn't peel off either. When it came to the fall/Halloween ones, I was able to keep them in the sun without them warping. I ended up using one with a lid for one of my mason jars and they don't leak either. Even after the jar was accidentally tipped over and left that way overnight, no leaking at all. Great quality lids for either arts and crafts or even when it comes to preventing leaks."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"The shears cut through chicken and duck bones well and an overall, all-around performer. Little effort was expended to cut through some of the tougher meats that my previous scissors struggled on. Whether the edges and the handle remain solid during prolonged use remains to be seen. It separates for easier cleaning."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"The snacks are quite delicious. The Cinnamon Churro tastes like a Churro, especially if you dip it into melted, hot chocolate. The Caramel Sea Salt was good too, though too sweet for my taste. And finally, the Mint Chocolate -- I didn't try. Mint Chocolate ice cream never had been a flavor I liked, and so I asked my son to try it instead. He liked it. Worth the price? At a bit over $3.50/pack, it makes for a good snack. UPDATE: I went to try the Chocolate Mint anyway. It tastes exactly like that... Chocolate Mint."
Outdoor Enthusiast,The telescoping pole is a GREAT idea! Helps this duster take less storage space while being able to hit a lot of the hard-to-reach areas in the house without needing a ladder. Detach the microfiber to machine or hand wash and it's ready for re-use. I immediately got rid of our feather duster.
Ronny Acosta,"The variety of stickers that comes with this set was a lot more than I thought I was going to get. They all arrived with their backings on them so there were no damaged stickers. The stickers themselves were all printed with no issues wrong with them. All pictures were clear enough that you knew who was who. Not to mention, I wasn't just stuck with just DC characters or Marvel, it had enough of both. When it came to sticking these on anything, I just had to make sure that the surface was clean. When it comes to being on a water bottle, these stickers are all still attached. While I don't put any of my water bottles in the dishwasher, these do get hand washed. Even with all the washing, all of these stickers are still on them. The only issue I had was 1 coming off but I didn't stick it on good enough and it got stuck on my gym bag and came off. So make sure that all stickers are stuck on the surface completely before using. Other than that little issue, great stickers and very vibrant colors."
Ronny Acosta,"There are quite a few bat stickers that come in this bunch but they are so cute. There are some that are kid approved stickers and then there are a few that are more teen and adult. However, with this mixture of stickers, my family and I were able to find something for everyone. The quality of the stickers are very good. They're not printed on paper but they are waterproof. I was able to put a few on my laptop, but I do suggest making sure there is nothing on the surface that you're putting the sticker on because there could be some issues with the sticker completely sticking onto that surface. When it comes to putting on water bottles, I was able to stick these on plastic and metal water bottles with no issues. Even after hand washing those water bottles, the stickers are still attached, but I don't soak any of them. Vibrant colors and really easy to use."
Ronny Acosta,"There have been a few times I had to work graveyard shifts and while my curtains don't fully block out the sun, this sleeping mask really does. The cutouts around the eyes not only don't put pressure on my eyeballs themselves, but they actually help to completely block out the sun. No matter which way I lay or move, this mask stays on my face and keeps the lights out. The strap in the back is fully adjustable and doesn't feel like it's ever too tight or too loose. The mask itself is really comfortable to wear whether it's during the day or at night. The nice thing about this face mask is it's fully washable, I just choose to hang dry it. Even after washing this mask, it still has it's shape and once again, goes back to blocking out any lights."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"There is not much to say about this hand sanitizer. It works and looks like the portable Purell ones, but at a slightly lower price. It smells and feels familiar. 75% alcohol is what's recommended against bacteria, though keep in mind that these hand sanitizers won't be as effective as soap and hot water for 20+ seconds. Still, they are better to have than nothing. Rubber sleeve stayed on securely onto the backpack. The bottles arrived in a small, not-sealed cardboard box."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"There is not really much to say about this pair of bags. They are small enough for me to fit the essentials for backpacking (like Band-aids for the kids -- the single most important item to them no matter how we, the parents, disagree about how bad their tiny scratches are) and to keep an extra set in the car. Feels sturdy and well-made. Colors pop, especially the red."
Outdoor Enthusiast,These are a lot cheaper than what I found at Costco for the same total length. Plug is standard waterproofing and the lighting modes can be switched by pushing a covered button by the plug. The warm white color is comforting and much preferred over the cool white.
Outdoor Enthusiast,"These are just like the ones I bought at Home Depot but for much less. Looks and feels the same. I use them to grow tomatoes, but unlike heavy-duty stakes, I won't be using this cage for Dragonfruit (as they can get very heavy). The cage can also be configured to be more like a wall, but I prefer to keep it as a cage for tomatoes."
Outdoor Enthusiast,These are not considered the highest quality mushrooms I have ever purchased as the sizes vary. But I don't care if they are all the same size. What matters is flavor and if they are affordable. These are just as good as the much more expensive ones. Great shiitake taste. I can use as many as I want with these as they are not as expensive as shiitake sold by the ounce. They provide a chewy/meaty addition to beans and vegetarian chilies.

Outdoor Enthusiast,"These boots are attractive but are completely uncomfortable. I usually wear 8.5, but only had a choice between 8 or 9. Some size 9 boots will work fine for my feet. Not these ones. Tried walking in the size 9 and ended up with a blister on my left pinkie toe because it's a bit too large. Perhaps the fit would have been better if these shoes came in half size options. I can not recommend these for hiking unless you're size 9."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"These carabiners are very inexpensive and as such, be aware of the limitations: they will NOT securely hold your gear as well as the twist-lock ones. Definitely never use them for climbing! With all that said, what they are great for is to clip lightweight items to your backpack or things you do not mind losing in case of failure. These types of carabiners can fail over time and not stay shut. I lost one of my favorite hats during a hike once -- I was really saddened as it had been with me on my very first, wilderness backpacking trip and through every, single marathon/half marathon. They are very lightweight. If you want something more secure, look into the thicker, heavier, more expensive twist-lock carabiners."
Ronny Acosta,"These earbuds are very lightweight especially when wearing these after a neck injury and trying to do physical therapy and just light working out. The earbuds are really comfortable to wear and what I really love are the yellow ear pieces that come with these earbuds. I don't really care for the smaller ones and these not only feel a lot more comfortable but when it comes to blocking out the outside noise, these are the ear pieces to go with. Even on the low setting, I can barely hear anything that is going on outside of these earbuds. They stay in my ears throughout using these doing my earbuds and I'm still able to change volume, songs, etc. on with the remote that is attached onto these earbuds. Plus I don't have to worry about losing these, especially if I take them out because the magnet on these are really strong. Great sound quality too."
Ronny Acosta,"These foil flakes are so easy to work with. I found these a lot easier to work with than working with the sheets. The tweezers these came with really did help with picking these up but I also used wooden sticks when it came to working and mixing these in with the resin I use. The flakes themselves are super shiny and even with being inside of hardened resin, they still shine and sparkle. These are delicate but found that if I don't press too hard on these, they don't tear so easily. The color variety you get in this set are just so vibrant and bright. They can get a little messy at times, but as you can see with the picture I included with a tray that I made, I was able to mix these flakes with sprinkles and they really do add that little something to any craft piece I make."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"These pants feel good to wear, fit me well around the waist (34), but is a tad too long (I normally wear a size 34x30 pants and am 5'7""). They do not look baggy or feel tight. The black areas are purely cosmetic as they are in no way reinforced. Water does bead off the pants, but I'd imagine that like many hiking pants, they'll eventually get somewhat wet during a prolonged walk in the rain. Can't beat the price at $28."
Ronny Acosta,"These shoe boxes are not only sturdy but so much stronger than what I thought they were going to be. When it comes to space, when placing my high top tennis shoes inside, they actually fit. I bought these to replace other ones that I had that were not only flimsy but were such a waste of money. These don't require me to tape them together in order that they stay put together. With these shoe boxes, they stay locked in place that no matter how much I put my shoes inside or take them out, they are still put together. The lids open up fairly easily but once you close it, they don't just randomly open up on their own. They not only protect my shoes from dust, dirty and debris floating around but also help keep pet fur off of them. These boxes were so great, I ended up buying another set. Will definitely be buying more of these to store my shoes inside. The only complaint that I have is I wish they came in more than just the 2 packs. However, these are definitely worth using and protects my shoes better than just keeping them inside of the shoe boxes they originally came in."
Ronny Acosta,"These weights not only help with space but they're so easy to use. I do have a weight bench that I'm also able to use these on when I use the full bar. When it comes to using, when I twist the bar as tight as it can go, the bars do not come undone or loosen up while I'm using. When it comes to switching the weights, I am easily able to do this as if I was using any other type weight set. The plastic piece that holds the weights in place really does prevent them from moving, falling off or even wobbling around while using. I've been able to do all sorts of different lifting exercises and no matter what muscles I'm working on, using this weight set really does help with working and toning things up. I did not want something too heavy and since this only goes up to 66lbs, this weight set is perfect for me. The grip that is on the bars are not only perfectly padded but even with wearing my gloves, they prevent any slipping. Easy to use and great when you have a small space to workout in."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"These work wonderfully for our camp fire skewers. The tips are extremely sharp and so be careful not to let the kids play with or be anywhere near them. We used these strictly for cooking, then removed the food off the skewer for the kids to enjoy. Washed easily and the included carry tube is a nice touch. The skewers do get very hot when left over the fire and so be sure to bring some gloves or napkins with you to handle the hot metal. We prefer metal skewers over wood ones because 1) you don't have to worry about wood splinters being stuck somewhere in the food, and 2) fire won't set the skewers on fire (with wood, you have to soak them first)"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This bag does not fit my Metakoo Cybertrack 100 or Googo electric mountain bike. It is too large for them since the battery is in the way. With that said, I did attach it to my Santa Cruz mechanical mountain bike. It was easy to install onto the bike's top tube through two top and one rear velcros. There was a decent amount of space to hold small items, such as keys, sunglasses, snacks, or repair tools. The bag is water resistant -- note the keyword: resistant. It is not waterproof. It will hold up fine under rainy conditions, but be sure to check that no opening is exposed in order to keep any water out. Side mesh pocket is where I put my paper map."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"This bag was easy to install onto the bike's top tube through two bottom and one front velcros. My Samsung Galaxy S21+ and iPhone Xr fit. There is decent space to hold small items, such as keys, sunglasses, snacks, or repair tools. The bag is water resistant -- note the keyword: resistant. It is not waterproof. It will hold up fine under rainy conditions, but be sure to check that no opening is exposed in order to keep any water out. Overall, well-made construction and priced reasonably well."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This bag was easy to install onto the bike's top tube through two bottom and one front velcros. My Samsung Galaxy S9+ and iPhone Xr fit into the phone holder (just one at a time) and their touch screens were usable, though not great. Below the holder, there is decent space to hold small items, such as keys, sunglasses, snacks, or repair tools. Even during one of my falls, the LIGHT content stayed fairly secure, but if you have heavier items, the bag actually opened up, potentially putting whatever was inside at risk of getting thrown onto the ground. The bag is water resistant -- note the keyword: resistant. It is not waterproof. It will hold up fine under rainy conditions, but be sure to check that no opening is exposed in order to keep any water out. There is a headphone opening on the tail end, but nowadays, Bluetooth headphone (in one ear, not both -- for safety reasons) are the way to go anyway. Overall, well-made construction and priced reasonably well."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This bag was easy to install onto the bike's top tube through two top and one front velcros.

The bag is water resistant -- note the keyword: resistant. It is not waterproof. It will hold up fine under rainy conditions, but be sure to check that no opening is exposed in order to keep any water out.

Outdoor Enthusiast,"This broth tastes quite good. Be sure you got the water mixture right: add 8oz of hot water (1 cup) for each pouch and wait a minute. Not having to make anchovy-based broth from scratch is a huge time saver, especially if we want Korean Soon Tofu asap during colder nights."
Ronny Acosta,"This canopy did take a minute to set up but once it's up, it's a great play area for any little one. We've been able to set this up outside, at family gatherings, at the beach, at a camp site and really can be used anywhere. We recently took this with us for a trip to the park where we were there practically all day. Not only was I able to put my little on inside of this, but there is more than enough room for them to play in without having to worry about them getting dirty from the ground. I was able to feed, change and even have them nap inside of this without worrying where to put them for all of this. We were able to enjoy our whole day out with this canopy. Taking it apart did take some time but this does come with a storage bag that hardly takes up any space in our garage. Really easy to grab and go. Plus with the mesh netting, it prevents from any bugs from coming it but still allows for a nice cool breeze to come through so it doesn't get too hot and stuff inside of the canopy. Plus the great thing about this is it can actually be used for a tent if need be. We set this up in our backyard and the kids ended up doing a camping trip in our backyard and use this as their tent."
Ronny Acosta,"This chair works great for small spaces. I work out in the field in an office trailer and while there's a good amount of space, where my desk is, I'm limited on space, including office chairs. The best part about this chair is not only does it work great for the space but I'm not required to have a floor mat. I'm able to move around the thin carpet that is installed with no issues. My last one would require me to stand up in order to move my chair to my desk but with the wheels on this chair, I'm able to just pull myself to my desk or walk it while sitting down. Whether someone is sitting in this chair or not, it rolls around with ease. The comfort on this chair is perfect too. Great lumbar support and I no longer need my pillow to help. Really easy to put together and easy to adjust to where I want it to be at."
Ronny Acosta,"This fridge may look tiny, but don't let the size of it fool you. This fits perfectly on my bathroom counter which if I wanted to, I could really put this on the floor but love that it's at my reach. When this first came in, I plugged it in and it started right away. On the front, I am able to turn it on and set the temperature for it. Inside, there are so many shelves and this has so much space. The shelves on the side not only have a bar that goes across but it holds any size of bottles that I have and holds them in place. Personally, I found this to be great because I have a few expensive glass bottles and they fit inside of these holders perfectly. Plus I never have to worry about them dropping every time I open the door. The inside area has more than enough room that I was able to put a small bottle of aloe gel inside without it taking up a lot of space. The drawer easily comes out and found that I was able to put my face, eye and lips masks inside of it. Overall, this fridge is fairly light weight but it is easy to move around when I need to. I can just wipe this clean too. Keeps my face products at the perfect temperature and hardly makes any noise."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This is a big improvement over my grandma's walker. The 8"" wheels roll smoothly over all kinds of surfaces and do not hang up at bumps. It is quite stable, sturdy and easy to assemble. It was already mostly assembled. You may need pliers for tightening and a screwdriver to widen slots or push in cables. Grandma gave me two thumbs up while sitting on it! haha"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This is a snowball, snow cone, Hawaiian shaved ice flavor concentrate. It makes enough for one gallon. You add the correct ratio of this flavor to a simple syrup of your own making and then add to the shaved ice you have also made. Delicious. I have received numerous compliments on my at-home shaved ice using this concentrate. Kids of course always love shaved ice!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This is an EXCELLENT glue for attaching D-Rings to inflatable stand up paddle boards (iSUP) and for repairing leaks with vinyl. It has been holding my D-Rings very securely and that is how I had turned my iSUPs to kayaks with the addition of kayak seats. For a step-by-step how-to on using this glue, I followed the blog post found via Google with the following search: ""Yuenx Convert Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board to Kayak"". That site shows how to glue and has a number of pictures to follow along with. Turning my iSUPs into kayaks has made my iSUP investments more versatile for whatever activity I am in the mood for."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This is our 3rd foam mattress purchase. We needed to replace our vacation home's worn mattress topper that felt awkward to sleep on at various spots. It did not make for a good night's sleep. Rather than replacing the entire mattress, we looked for something more economical. I have a bad back and had always preferred firm, box spring mattresses. I actually quite liked the Inofia foam mattress we got for our son back in January 2021, and my back did not hurt at all sleeping on it. So, we looked for a queen size, but Inofia did not have any available. Novilla popped up with thousands of reviews. Decided to grab one. The mattress, like the other foam ones we previously bought, arrived in a narrow, tall, rolled-up package. It's quite a sight to see something that would be large fit in such small package. Per the included instructions, I carefully cut open the vacuum-sealed bag and let it sit on the room floor for 72 hours to let it fully re-inflate. I actually jumped on it after the first day because it looked already ready for use, but we let it sit for the full 3 days anyway. Verdict? It evenly deflated, felt VERY comfortable and firm enough to not hurt my back. It felt especially comfortable while on my stomach. How long these foam mattresses will last remains to be seen, but for now, I am a fan of that technology."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This is our second purchase from Inofia for a 6"" twin mattress for our son's bunk bed. His sister is going to be joining him soon, graduating from her crib. So, we bought our second mattress for use with the upper bunk bed. I have a bad back and had always preferred firm, box spring mattresses. I actually quite liked the Inofia foam mattress we got for our son back in January 2021, and my back did not hurt at all sleeping on it. This one, like the previous purchase, arrived in a surprisingly narrow, tall, rolled-up package -- my mother-in-law and I both looked at it in awe. Per the included instructions, I carefully cut open the vacuum-sealed bag and let it sit on the living room floor for 72 hours to let it fully re-inflate. I actually jumped on it after the first day because it looked already ready for use, but we let it sit for the full 3 days anyway.  Verdict? It evenly deflated, felt VERY comfortable and firm enough to not hurt my back. I'm actually contemplating of getting a queen size foam mattress for our own bed, but since our spring mattress is still very good (and firm), we are not going to spend extra money. Either way, sometimes I go take a nap in my son's bunk bed and am amazed by how well a foam mattress sleeps in. Happy to have purchased our second one for our baby girl to sleep on soon."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This is really a simple product. You fold it open, fill with water, and the weight of the liquid holds the frame sturdy. Drain through the drain plug. I have both an inflatable swimming pool (purchased last summer when COVID kept us out of public pools) and now this foldable one. I much prefer the inflatables for their safety -- no hard edges for kids to get hurt on, but this foldable is also good because it makes for MUCH faster setup and putting away. In a sense, both types of pools are good. I feel that this foldable pool will last longer than the inflatables and because it sets ups and is put away faster, I would most likely use this more than the inflatables."
Ronny Acosta,"This mini projector is super lightweight and so easy to take anywhere. Whether we're staying at a hotel, going camping or just watching movies in our backyard, this mini projector is compact and definitely portable for anywhere. What I love is that even if we don't take our projector screen or our foldable one, we have been able to use a white sheet and whatever we have playing, still works on just that. This is not a bluetooth compatible projector, however it does come with cables that connect easily to our laptop and we were able to connect the projector that way. While it didn't come with one, we ended up buying a HDMI cord for our phone and we were able to play movies and watch shows that way as well. There is a speak on the back and while it can get loud, if we have a lot of people over, we have been able to connect this to our portable speaker. The remote makes it that more convenient too. Great portability and such a fun way to watch movies and TV shows."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This modem works with Cox and Spectrum. Arris Surfboard SB6141 is one of the staple modems for reliability and performance. It is a good way to save yourself the fees that cable companies charge to ""rent"" their ""best in class"" modems. Please...! In just a year, you could have bought yourself a modem already. Setup is usually simple. Plug in the modem (with the coax cable and power), call your internet service provider that you want to add your own to the account, and they'll ask you for the model number, serial number, and MAC address. All of that information can be found on the sticker at the bottom. Then they'll have you read off the status of the lights, they'll check that your modem is sending/receiving signals, then you plug in your router/WiFi and/or laptop to test for internet. Check your internet provider's modem compatibility list before you buy this or any other. You can usually search the web for something like ""Spectrum Modem Compatibility List"" to get it. DOCSIS 3.0 is older technology. DOCSIS 3.1 is needed if you want to go with a service plan as fast as 2,048 Mbps (2 Gbps) -- like Google Fiber."
Ronny Acosta,"This patio gazebo is not lightweight and can take at least 2 people to carry it, whether it's inside of the box or out. When it was out and setup, it did take 4 of us to move it into place. When it comes to putting this together, this did come with very detailed instructions and was fairly easy to setup. I did use my own tools as they do have better grips, plus it's just easier for me. The canvas cover that goes on top is fairly thick and not cheap or thin. This does come with privacy curtains, however, we had some netting ones that we wanted on this instead and found that we were able to use them instead of the thicker one. However, once winter comes, that is when we will switch them out. This gazebo is very sturdy and even when you're underneath, it doesn't get warm or stuffy. The opening on the top not only allows for a nice cool breeze but it ensures that if you're inside of the gazebo, that inside stays nice and refreshing rather than humid. We did install some outdoor lights on this because where we have it, once the sun goes down, it can get pretty dark. This gazebo has gotten wet from our sprinklers, but even then, the water seems to just drip off of the canopy rather than soak through. We have not had or seen any rusting on any of the poles either. Not only is the material on the cover made of quality fabric but even the metal itself doesn't bend or rust easily. For the price and quality of what I received, I am very happy and love that it provides great shade."
Ronny Acosta,"This phone holder has 2 options to use. The first is if I want, I can actually use the vent clip to clip this onto any vent in either car. I have a car that has vertical vents and another that has horizontal. No matter which way the vents are, the clip that comes with this phone mount allows me to use it either way. However, my favorite and the way I've been using this has been in my cup holder. I use this in my work car and while I really never have a passenger, I only use 1 out of the 2 cup holders that I have. With this cup holder version, I'm able to twist and tighten this holder so that it doesn't move. Even with me grabbing my phone quickly or driving over bumpy roads, this phone holder stays in place. Once I twist to release, then it will start to tilt, especially if I have my phone in the holder. Really easy to use and great to have the extra feature of using this whichever way I want to."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This phone holder is very sturdy and fits any cup size thanks to its expandable base. The neck is solid and stays in place. Phone is held with a strong grip. To use, push two side buttons towards the bottom -- that releases the gripping sides. Place phone between the sides and push them tight towards the center. Voila. Phone is secured. There are a couple places to route the charging cable through so it is more easily accessible to connect the phone to. Phone is held up quite high so it's visible, but not high enough to be used as a navigation device without having to take your eyes off the road. Also keep in mind that you lose a cup holder spot when this device is used. Can be rotated to use phone horizontally."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"This set of seal stickers work VERY well. Taped them onto a box, let dry for 24 hours, and when I tried to pry it off, it left a security mark behind. Note that if you tape and try to immediately (but carefully) review it, I was able to do so without triggering the seal residue. That's why I found it to be most effective if left to stick for at least 8 hours for the glue to settle and harden."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This set works exactly like what you would expect from a Chapstick. The only thing that sets it different from all its other offerings is the flavor: birthday cake. Did it taste like one? Yes. Vanilla cake. I find it slightly odd having the taste of vanilla on my lips, but it is appropriate as a birthday favor."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This table has been a good investment as it has served us in a variety of environments and ways, both indoor and outdoor. We have been working from home a lot due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and my wife uses it sometimes to work outside in the backyard since it's light and fast to set up and take down. All she has to do is extend the legs and snap on the table top. Done. She's certainly liked it more than the heavy, plastic Costco ones she used to ask me to set up -- and since I don't have to do it any more, that makes me a happy camper too, but of course, I'd always gladly help my wife be in a better environment. Happy wife means happy life. For camping, the table's compact size effortlessly fits into our car's trunk, but we have also used it at parks, beaches, and parking lots for our kids to feed on. The biggest drawback for using the table on a beach is the sand getting into the legs. So, we often have to rinse it off with water and wipe dry. For those who have difficulty setting up the legs at equal heights, you could mark them with lines and numbers. The light weight of the table could be blown down by a strong gust of wind, and so we recommend you anchor it down with some heavier objects. Overall, this table has served us well and is best suited for 1-2 persons."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This tray is really simple, yet effective: use it as a normal tray or expand it to hold bigger/longer items. It's all plastic. Both the main tray and the sliding portion can be separated. I use the main tray with my small drawer and the slider as a paper holder."
Ronny Acosta,"This was my first time changing out my trailer's lock and the instructions that came with this lock, made it a lot easier for me to do so. When it came to fitting this on, it fit practically perfectly in the old spot. Setting up the locking code was really easy to do, but do suggest picking something hard. Not to mention, make sure you are pressing the actual number and not in between. During the day, the pad can be clearly seen. However at night, there is a light that turns on so even though it's dark, I don't need a flashlight to see what I'm pushing. This does not stay on all night but will only turn on if something is pressed. This came with everything needed not just to change out my lock, but 2 keys and 1 remote. I found that the furthest I was able to use the remote was roughly 60 feet away from my trailer, give or take. Whether I'm using this keypad during a camping trip or just added security while at home, this lock has been so much easier to have. Not only because it was so easy to switch out but I feel a lot more secure having this on it. Not to mention, if we accidentally leave the keys in the trailer, we're still able to get in with the keypad. Love all the features this lock pad has to offer and love how easy it is to use."
Ronny Acosta,"This was my first time using these and at first I thought they were going to be uncomfortable, leak and possibly painful to put and keep in. To my surprise, that wasn't the case. When it came to using, I did sterilize these before actually using. I ended up buying a pot just for these cups. When it came to using, I just followed the instructions on how to insert and done. At first I felt the smaller cup inside and did still wear a pad for the just in case. However, after a few hours, I completely forgot about them. Not to mention, no leaks. I have worn these several times now and no matter the size of cup I use, no leaking at all. Plus, whether I'm using the smaller or bigger cups, I can't even tell that I'm wearing one. I've been able to workout, do errands, lounge around the house and not have to worry about how long I've had it inside or leaking. Really safe to use and really easy to clean. Not to mention, I'm saving so much money."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"This was really simple: Not too spicy and quite literally, full of flavor. I had used it as a rub for grilling and smoking in a little cook off against a Korean chili seasoning + Killer Hogs BBQ Rub, and the latter by itself, on chicken legs smoked with Jack Daniels wood barrel. The verdict? I preferred the Korean chili one the most, but all three tasted delicious that I would not mind going for any one of them -- or having all three available for variety. I have not yet used it to make jambalaya, gumbo, or shrimp/crawfish, but that's next on the list! You can also add it for some spice to Bloody Mary or beer. To Your Bloody Mary Or Beer!"

Ronny Acosta,"This watch is really comfortable to wear. The watch itself at first seemed like it was going to be heavy but once I put it on, it's really not. Once I downloaded the app, I was able to instantly connect my phone to the watch with no issues. Creating my profile through the app is really easy to do and I'm always able to update and change whatever I want to do. I'm also able to to set up what notifications I want this watch to notify me about and what I don't want it to. The charger that comes with this watch has a very strong magnet on it and doesn't come off easily if it's tipped over, which is helpful when I have a cat that always moves things on my nightstand. With this watch I'm able to keep track of a lot of things that I want monitored and I'm also able to track everything through the app. Really easy to use and manage too."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Took this car camping (boondocking) in late November in a social-distancing way. Temperatures outside were 40F by 4pm and dipped to 38F by the time we went to sleep in our own cars. On the final night, temperatures dropped to as low as 27F (according to my watch that was left inside the car!) What helped keep me warm? This bottle. Why? The cover adds additional insulation. However, this did not last as long as my Peter Pan 100oz hot bottle bag (2L = 67oz) because it's smaller capacity and has thinner walls, and thus, could not hold heat in for as long. However, it also is significantly cheaper than the Peter Pan. So, pros and cons. In a test with the Peter Pan and this heat bottle, how did both compare? On the final night when the morning temperature on the watch showed 27F (around 7am) and I had gone to sleep at about 10pm, this bottle was already cool whereas the Peter Pan was STILL barely warm! NINE hours later! It was inside the sleeping bag with me throughout the night. Water left outside the car (and a bottle inside) was solid frozen. That's how cold it was. So, at some point this particular bottle warmer lost its heat and did not last as long as the Peter Pan, but again, it also costs far less."

Ronny Acosta,"Unlike regular flash cards that require you to not only say the word but make the sound, this whole setup does it for you. The machine itself that holds the card is the perfect size for anyone little ones hand's to hold comfortably. The cards themselves are fair thick and strong enough for my kids and are still holding up great even after being delivered and used daily for almost 2 months. The machine itself is fully rechargeable so I don't have to keep buying batteries. When you insert a card, the machine reads it and not only says the word but makes the noise of whatever the picture shows. If you or the child chooses to have the word and sound repeated, you don't have to remove the card, just put the button on the front and it will repeat the word and sound that picture makes. Great for at home and for anywhere really. Great little learning tool and so much better than a tablet."
Ronny Acosta,"Unlike some of the cords that came with our phones, these last a lot longer, even when they're bent and pulled on. Even when they are bent, which they have numerous of times, these still will continue to charge phones and devices. The length of the cords is another thing which has been helpful because there are plugs that are not close by but even with phones and devices plugged in, we are still within reach of our devices. We just got a new puppy and another thing I am most impressed with is we caught them chewing on the cord and the cord itself was covered in drool but only a few strands of the nylon wrapping was out of place. The cord still charges and works great. Not to mention, it still charges devices fast too."
Ronny Acosta,"Unlike some rose petals that I've purchased in the past, these are so much more thicker and really withstand almost anything. Previous rose petals usually are thin and will start to shed and fray, especially around the edges. With these rose petals, I have not had that issue all all. The petals are a deep, dark red color which was what I was wanting. From afar, they actually look like real rose petals but when you get up close, you can kind of tell that these are fake. The petals themselves are really soft too. When it came to using for decorating, I found that they don't stick to each other. Also, when water or any type of liquid gets on these, the colors don't bleed either."
Ronny Acosta,"Unlike the regular masks that I bought for the older people in my family, they don't fit my little ones' faces very well. I bought these in hopes they wouldn't be too big and they fit perfectly. For my younger one, I did have to twist the ear loops but more importantly, the mask fits their face perfectly. Even with the one a few years older, fits perfectly. There is not gapping and the metal piece that goes across the nose isn't too hard to press in order for it to mold to their nose. Perfectly goes under their chins too. Quality masks that not only still lets them breathe but doesn't cause red marks on their ears either. Great for either going out or for going to school."
Ronny Acosta,"Unlike the tape lint rollers, there is no waste with this lint roller. It is fully reusable and as long as I go in the same direction when wiping whatever off like lint, pet fur or whatever else is on my fabrics, this lint roller gets it off. When it comes to cleaning it off, I just wipe the lint roller in the opposite direction and everything comes off. Some of the finer fur or lint that gets trapped, which is rare, I just take a damp paper towel and wipe it clean. What I love about this lint roller is it folds down to practically nothing and fits inside of my glove compartment and center console in my car. This not only works on my clothes but also the seats in my car. Again, as long as I use this brush in the same direction, I don't have to worry about anything coming off and going back onto my clothes."
Ronny Acosta,"Unlike with most security cameras, the night vision on this isn't black, white and grainy. With the light on the camera, it actually comes out in color and allows us to clearly see a person's face, clearly see the color of vehicles, make, model and even the license plate depending on which way they park. The picture quality on this is so clear that we were able to catch people who were attempting to break into people's cars. If it weren't for this camera, we wouldn't have been able to make clear IDs along with the make, model, color and license plate of their car. Rather than just reporting it and going no where, local PD were actually able to make arrests. The lights on this camera are motion detection only meaning they only turn on when motion is detected. Whether it's day or night, we get clear picture and video quality without having to guess or stare at a blurry picture or video. Really easy to install and set everything up too."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"Used this with my Samsung Galaxy S21+ to see if it would fast-charge the phone. It did. Good, the charging port works fine.

The remaining 7 USB 3.0 ports performed quite well in data transfer tests between my Samsung Evo SSD drive and RavPower USB SSD. Powering up an external, USB-to-SATA device worked well with a mechanical Western Digital hard drive too for as long as you connect the AC adapter to this hub. Otherwise, the USB port itself won't have enough power to keep the hard drive running.

Windows 10 detected the hub with no issues at all, and any device you connected to the hub was detected and treated by the OS the same way as you would if plugged in directly to the motherboard's USB ports. Being able to individually turn on/off USB ports was a nice bonus so you don't have to keep plugging/unplugging devices. It's more compact than I had expected and looks and feels solid. Using the hub to power a keyboard or mouse is overkill for a Desktop PC, but for portable use with a laptop, this is perfect pairing. Hooking up a USB-powered, portable monitor worked well too, but again, be sure you use the included AC adapter to provide the necessary power. Plug in too many power-hungry devices though, and this USB hub will fail on you. That is to be expected for any hub."
Ronny Acosta,"Was looking for a nice but basic scarf and this is anything but basic. The fabric on this scarf is really soft. The picture, to me, made it look like the fabric might possibly be scratchy but it really isn't. For me at least, it looked like it might be. When it arrived, the first thing I did was touch the scarf to make sure and it really is soft. I ended up hand washing this at first but found that even after throwing this in my washer and hang drying it, it still is soft. The fringes at the end still looks great and have not frayed or look like they need to be trimmed. When wearing this around my neck, it really does keep my neck warm and even my ears. Soft fabric that helps keep me warm, very happy I bought this."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We are boba tea lovers and where we live, there are plenty of shops to choose from. I thought it would be a fun idea to get my wife this set so she could make some herself at home (she already had been with other products). Boba tea was invented in Taiwan and so we expected a kit made from that country to be of high quality. Indeed, it is. Boba balls took a while to soften up with multiple boil and drains, but that is normal. Of course, you can speed things up with microwave, but I prefer the traditional method to slowly and surely get it to the right consistency. That's actually authentic. Flavor-wise, it was pretty good and very similar to the tea shops we have around here, but it also is a tad too sweet. You can make up for that by adding more hot water than asked for or putting less of the flavoring packet. Brown Sugar Milk Tea has been the latest craze here in California. It's just too sweet for me, but that's perhaps part of the addiction. I still prefer the ones we get at our favorite tea shops, but in a pinch, this set will work fine at home. It could make for a cute gift for the boba tea lover."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We bought my son an analog wrist watch when he was 4 years old. Taught him how to read the hour hand, but we had no idea how to teach him the minute one since he could not yet count beyond 12 or so at the time. So, when telling time, we told him to read 7:45am, for example, as ""Time is 7 o'clock and 9"". With this time practice kit and now that he knows how to read numbers as high as 9,999, we completed the training by having him now read what the minute hand truly means. Within about a week, he was able to memorize that the 9 o'clock position means 45 minutes. Mission accomplished. Did we really need this kit? Not really. We could have drawn the clocks and minute marks ourselves too."
Ronny Acosta,"We bought this to take on trips and found that not only do I use this for trips but for at home use too. I took this on a hiking trip and while the sun was beating down, this fan did help keep me nice and cool. I was only on my hike for about 45-60 minutes and did turn this off and on several times but no matter what, this fan kept me cool and lasted the whole time out there. The fan itself is very light weight and there were even times I forgot I had this on. When at home, I have used this while doing yard work, cleaning out my garage and even while cooking outside. No matter where I use it, I have not had any issues with this overheating, dying out too soon or it falling off. The fan itself is fully adjustable and like I mentioned before, so light weight that it doesn't feel as though something is pulling my neck down. Charging this hardly takes any time but the battery life lasts a fairly long time. Great for adults, teens and kids."
Outdoor Enthusiast,We did not use beer -- we used apple juice instead. It came out delicious. Easy to use and quite stable on the grill. Count on about 1.5 hours on a charcoal grill. Chicken came out juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Perfect.
Ronny Acosta,"We don't have anything to help decorate our side garden area and these hooks help with that problem. The hooks themselves were really easy to install since all I had to do was insert the pole into the spikes. What I love about these poles is the fact that I have not had any issues with rusting at all with these poles of the spikes that go into the ground. Once the spikes are inserted into the ground, they are very stable and don't move very easily unless you really move them. I currently have Halloween lights that are hooked onto either side with small pumpkin buckets on the other hook. I love that I can not only use these for Halloween but for really any occasion. Very sturdy and even with the amount of water that gets on these poles, no rusting."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We followed a method by one of our favorite YouTube content makers. Boiled a large pot of water over fire. Put another pot containing this cornbread mix into the boiling water and covered the top but still allowing some steam to escape. You will know when the cornbread is ready when it rises and a toothpick you stick in comes out dry (no batter stuck to it.) This method surprisingly allows for quite a moist cornbread, and if you like the crispiness of the edges, you could ""toast"" it over the fire for a few more minutes all over (by sticking it on a skewer and rotating). Delicious! Not too sweet, yet dense, fulfilling, and moist. Yum. You can also make this cornbread by putting the mix in a hollowed-out, half orange peel and wrapping with tin foil. Poke a few holes at the top and watch for the bread to rise through the hole. Test with toothpick and enjoy!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We go camping a lot and one of the concerns we have are bears. Mind you, I have been hiking/camping/wilderness backpacking for 16+ years and have come across a number of wildlife, including bears. Even had an encounter where I saw a young one next to our tent because one of my friends did not put away her toothbrush and paste like she was supposed to. With that said, there have been times where we have gone camping on dispersed land, and with no bear containers available, an early alert system was something I needed. I use these in conjunction with a string (ie. fishing line) to create a perimeter around our camp. When an animal trips the wire, the alarm goes off, and we'd have some time to react. Thus far, we have not yet encountered a bear in our camp for the past 6 trips, but we did find a coyote trip the alarm and a couple, wild humans who forgot that we had set up a perimeter all around. Once the alarm goes off, the most difficult part at night is to immediately having to go up, check the surrounding, and re-insert the pin to stop the sound. You can imagine how annoyed neighbors might get."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We got a bunch of these for our investment property where the windows are pretty old (at least 40 years!) We do not yet have the funding to do a window/door replacement, and so this weather stripping would be serving as a temporary stop gap until then. Usage is simple: Clean the window/door frame and let dry, Stick the foam in, Press down to ensure the adhesive sticks well. Done. Make sure you get the right size for your frame width."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We got one of these for our vacation home for use as a short-term rental (ie. AirBnb). We wanted one that looked ""luxurious"" enough for the decor we have, and indeed, this one does. It feels very solid, heated up about as expected for water to boil in the 6,000' elevation mountain, and the whistle was loud enough to be heard. We genuinely like this kettle."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We got this toaster for our vacation home to be used as a short-term rental (ie. AirBnb). So, we wanted something that looked decently classy and clean, but was cheap enough to feed a larger family. This one fit the bill -- the lights make it look more expensive than it is, and the 4 slots allow for toasting of up to as many items of various thickness levels. Works like what you'd expect from a toaster, and the crumb catcher at the bottom can be pulled out for easier cleaning. How long it will last, we shall see. It is pretty cool that you can independently control the toast level for each slot pair."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We had a bed bug infestation at our apartment over a decade ago. It was not fun. Itches and bites all over the body for nearly a month, if I remember correctly. Steam cleaning, multiple high-heat washes and dryings did not help much. Bed bugs and fleas could spread across the home. How did we get these bugs into our home in the first place? No idea. We do hike. We do also have people come over to entertain. Not wanting to deal with infestations any more, we bought mattress covers. It sort of makes sense why my Asian parents never remove the plastic from their mattresses -- not only to keep the surfaces pristine, but to also waterproof and keep bugs out. But that looks ghetto. We also use these covers to prevent accidental leaks from our kids while they are still potty training. Well worth the purchase. Haven't had a bug infestation in a long while."
Ronny Acosta,"We had a very long power outage and luckily this flashlight was bright enough to actually light up a whole room. We lost power when it was already dark and the great thing about this flashlight is how bright it is, which is surprising considering it's size. We were able to stand this up on a table and it was bright enough the illuminate a whole room. It was enough that we never once tripped over anything and we were able to see what was on the floor. We had this flashlight running for over an hour and even through that whole time, it never once became hot or even died. This flashlight is fully rechargeable and not only works indoors but outdoors as well. This has gotten wet on several occasions and still worked with no flickering or flashing. It has not only held up great during our outdoor trips but even for at home use. Lightweight and easy to hold or even carry around."
Ronny Acosta,"We have a 7 month old puppy who still chews on everything and these toys are still lasting since getting these almost 2 months ago. We have 2 other dogs, one is an aggressive chewer who will not stop chewing toys until they're destroyed and another who only chews when left home alone for too long. Even with all of them chewing and destroying toys, these toys are still looking good. Some of the ropes look a little frayed, but they are all still knotted and still in the same shape as they were before they started playing with them. We have not given them all of the toys, only about 2/3's of them but the ones that they are currently playing with, still look great and are not fully destroyed or really even close to it."
Ronny Acosta,"We have a couple of different projectors, a wifi and a non-wifi one and while we love both of them, they can sometimes come out a little grainy. However, this projector is a huge upgrade from those one. Not only does it play similar to our expensive TV, but the picture quality has absolutely no grainy picture at all. This can be used with either a flashdrive or by connecting it to your wifi. This does have a bluetooth connection so connecting this to our bluetooth speakers is really easy to do. There is volume on this but when it's only a few of us, we can hear it clearly. However, when we have more than 3-4 people over, connecting this to a louder speaker is very helpful. I included a video and picture of what the playback quality looks like. While I do have a projector, I wanted to show that even with just a plain white sheet, the picture quality is still amazing. When we play this on our actual screen, it's even better. Comes with everything needed and love that we're able to easily store this in the case that it came with. Great for movies, watching games and really anything. Great picture quality!"
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We have a vacation home in the mountains and these look good for our dark, glass table top. Some encouraging words about living and loving life. As expected, the cork absorbs water well -- purpose of a coaster, right? They are a big thicker than I would like, however."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We have used these to float down the Kern River near Sequoia National park. As expected, they held up well even for a 190 lb guy, though I felt a little less sturdy on it than with a 47"" tube I had also brought. We have also used these as a floating bar to hold some drinks around the pool. Will they work for snow? I would not advise it. The wall lining is not as thick as the 47"" tube I got, and though it may work for a light child, I would hesitate to use it on myself to ride down the snow. Could it be done? Sure. Might it pop or puncture on something? Probably. Would I get hurt? Probably not. Falling on snow isn't so bad as long as you steer clear of sharp or immovable objects. A small rope with carabiner is included for easier towing/pulling. For more fun, you can also form a chain of tubers with each person holding the handle of the other tube, then having everyone float down the river simultaneously. They pumped up with our battery-operated tool in just a few minutes. Deflated even quicker, though it took some time to completely remove all air for compact storage. Be careful about not folding the tube too harshly, or you'll break the inner wall structure faster and not make them last as long."

We have also used these as a floating bar to hold some drinks around the pool. Will they work for snow? We do not yet have snow in our immediate area to test on, though some has already fallen at a resort that takes 6-8 hours to drive to. Looking at the thickness of the tube and the two carry handles, I am certain that they will hold up quite well for inner tubing. Attach a thick rope to one of the handles for easier towing/pulling. For more fun, you can also form a chain of tubers with each person holding the handle of the other tube, then having everyone slide down simultaneously.

Outdoor Enthusiast,We have used these with our Philips Avent anti-colic bottles and they work well -- as expected since they are made by and for the same manufacturer. They leak a little but otherwise allow milk to flow nice and evenly.
Ronny Acosta,"We installed this in our garage because even with just doing laundry, we were getting bit by so many mosquitoes and had a lot of flies coming inside. With this bug zapper, we did have to use a ladder to install but all we had to do was put this on a hook that was already installed in one of the boards. When none of the lights are on, this bug zapper will practically light up our garage. When it comes to working, this thing works great. Whether we are getting ready to leave, coming home or out there doing laundry, this thing goes off so much. After only having this up the first week, we found so many dead mosquitoes and flies inside of this thing. When it comes to cleaning, we do need a ladder to clean this because it's up so high so it can be a bit much, but cleaning this is really easy. It did come with a brush that helps get the inside part as sometimes some bugs will get stuck on this. As for making noise, we don't really notice it's up there unless it zaps a bug and we're in our garage. Since having this up for almost 2 months, we have seen less and less bug bites from being in our garage. Even after being inside for over 3 hours from cleaning it out, no bug bites but a lot of zaps."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We love cooking with sea salt, especially when grilling/BBQing/smoking pork belly, steak, and skewers. With that said, this salt that supposedly comes from Africa has given our meats a very interesting, smoky, very mildly spicy flavor. Is it worth the $10 for 3.5 ounces? That is very hard to say because it is quite pricey. Would diners notice the flavor difference between it and just plain, coarse salt with chipotle flavor sprinkled around? Probably not. I, personally, would not buy this at $10, but it does add a good flavor."

Outdoor Enthusiast,"We love hot pot/shabu shabu. We love it even more with two different flavors. Add a BBQ grill into the mix, and we'd be in heaven (which this product does not provide, by the way). The pot feels sturdy and note that it's aluminum die cast. It is not a cast iron one. Nonetheless, it heated and retained heat pretty well, and cleanup was easy as expected: soap and rinse and nothing was sticking. There shouldn't be much sticking anyway since food is submerged under liquid at all times. It is dishwasher safe, the company claimed, and yep, it survived a couple washing cycles. Product claims to work with induction cook tops because of its aluminum alloy bottom."
Ronny Acosta,"We originally purchased this for our ducks but since we moved, we have a different area and no longer needed this chicken coop for them. However, we inherited chickens with the new house and now they're inside this coop. Putting this together was definitely a 2 person job which made this go so much easier and faster. I found that building the base and frame was a lot easier. At first, we did have to put bricks at the bottom of the opening because our ducks were trying to fit underneath, but with the chickens, we didn't have to do that. The coop itself is a lot sturdier than it looked, especially when we first took it out of the box. The sun cover really does shade where we have their house but still allows them to walk all the way around this even with their house inside of this coop. The structure of this is really strong and even with the breeze and wind gusts that we've had more recently, this chicken coop is still standing. Overall, this chicken coop is very structurally sound and has been a great way to keep our chickens safe from not just our dogs but other predators out where we live."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We own a multi-story home in the mountains. California wildfires have been more frequent, larger, and more devastating in the past, few years due to our extreme drought conditions and high winds (among other factors). We were concerned that our children might be stuck on the top floors with no way to escape if the stairs were engulfed in flames. The only way out: through the windows two or three stories high. These escape ladders would solve that problem for them: take them out of the box, attach to the window rim, unlock the steps, and climb down. We did a couple test runs and coached them to ALWAYS have 3 points of contacts on the ladder: meaning, there are 2 hands and 2 feet -- always keep 3 of those limbs on the ladder while moving. Learned this trick from ice climbing. WARNING: Packaging says the ladder can ONLY BE USED ONE TIME. After that, Kidde considers the integrity of the ladders as compromised. Should you practice? Heck yes. Can you practice? If you're a teenager or heavier, I would advise against it -- practice with ANOTHER unit instead (yes, it'll cost you money, but it's best everyone knows how to use the ladder in an emergency instead of at that very moment). I had my little kids practice under supervision. I also inspected the ladder afterwards before putting it back away."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We planted the seeds back in March and are now seeing large enough of a head to harvest. We snuck a few pieces to taste test and they were good. Be sure to always cut the head off before they start developing flowers. Once they flower, they'll become tough to eat. To minimize flowering, keep the roots cool by putting thicker layers of top soil. Heat hitting the roots will encourage flowering..."
Ronny Acosta,"We recently bought a pizza oven and found that our short pizza pan's handle was too short for this pizza oven. Not only does this handle work so much better, but we no longer have to worry about the heat or possibly burning ourselves. The handle on this is really strong and sturdy. Whether we have a frozen, defrosted, homemade or fully cooked pizza, this handle can take it. Not to mention the pan that holds everything is not made of cheap metal. The cutter works so much better than a traditional pizza cutter and doesn't require us to go through any pizza several times in order for the pizza to be cut. The other thing I love about this peel is that we were not only able to do pizzas but calzones, garlic bread and even a wire tray with chicken wings. At first I was worried about storing, but with the hook at the end, we're able to hang this inside of our pantry."
Ronny Acosta,"We use this laundry bag not only for home, but we were also able to use this at several hotel rooms and even in our camping trailer. While we have a decent amount of space in our bathroom, I found that hanging this on the door was so much easier than having dirty laundry everywhere. This is really easy to hang on really any door and really comes in handy. Even if we stay in a hotel room, we can easily hang it up and even when its full, the fabric on this doesn't tear easily. When full, we're able to just dump everything in our washer, including the laundry bag itself. While we don't dry this bag, it dries pretty fast when hung up on a hanger. The bag is made of really good fabric and holds strong, even with a bunch of dirty towels inside. Easy to carry and makes it so much easier to carry things to our washer."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We usually get dried cranberries and thought to give blueberries a try. Quite delicious! Which one do we prefer? Well, we still like the cranberries. Depends on the mood, but doesn't hurt to have both available for snacking."
Ronny Acosta,"We usually have weekly Uno family games but when you have to use 2-3 decks, shuffling them can be very tedious and tiring. We bought this in hopes it would work and it really does. We're able to put 2.5 decks in this shuffler and not only does it shuffle them a lot faster but it makes it so much easier too. Even when we have long games and keep needing more and more cards shuffled, we just put them in this and it will shuffle them for us. Not to mention, we don't have to worry about cards getting bent, torn or even flying around the table. The other cool thing is that no one can see the cards that are being shuffled. This did not come with batteries and I did have to go out and buy them, however, it doesn't kill the batteries. We have used this several days out of the week and we still have the same batteries that we put in this shuffler when we got it about a month ago. Great for Uno cards, regular playing cards and even Cards Against Humanity cards."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We would like to be as eco-friendly as possible. For that reason, we ""banned"" one-time-use items for our camping trips for a few years already, such as plastic cups, plates, and utensils. This set of sugarcane-based plates supposedly will help solve that problem. Why? According to another manufacturer, ""sugarcane products normally biodegrade within 90 days; plastics will take up to 400 years to degrade and styrofoam never degrades!"" With that said, these plates held up sturdy enough against juicy burgers, BBQ, and even stews, but one thing to be mindful of: rice will stick and individual grains will be hard to pick off. Other than that, we like this product. Now we can bring single-use plates back to camping without adding a significant burden onto our waste management."
Outdoor Enthusiast,"We've had one of these for a couple years now and got another set when our youngest started fighting with the older one for the broom, dust pan, or mop. We got the older one (son) to start sweeping the kitchen after every meal to earn points towards a reward. Like story time before sleep, a favorite YouTube episode on the weekend, or mommy/daddy time after work. The youngest (daughter) grabbed the mop each time to try to help him sweep, and of course, she'd often try to use the same items that her brother was holding. Got another set. Have both kids now sweep (daughter makes a huge mess, son does a better job each time). He does it to earn points and she does it to mimic her brother. Win-win for everyone involved! We use this to teach the kids to contribute to the household, earn rewards through work, and build self-esteem, work habit, and hand-eye coordination. He also started to sweep better than what he used to do: where he simply just went through the motion but crumbs and dirt were still all over the floor. Now he's learned to sweep them into smaller piles for pickup with the dust pan later -- provided his sister didn't ruin his work. ""Sweep and pick up faster than, son!"" And faster he did. Another win!"
Ronny Acosta,"What I didn't expect were these to actually keep my feet warm. I thought for sure with the openings that my feet would not stay warm but they do. When it comes to wearing, these not only keep my feet nice and warm but they're really comfortable too. The padding on the bottom of these is cushioned very well. I have worn these with and without socks and with whichever way I wear them, they always are soft and keep my feet warm. The nice thing about these are the bottoms. I didn't think they would actually have that much traction control but they really do. Whether I'm just walking in these around the house, walking outside or even cleaning in these, I have not had any issues with slipping. Really comfortable and after an month of wearing, still look and feel great."
Ronny Acosta,"What I didn't think this safe was going to be was so heavy duty. While I don't have a problem with that, I was completely surprised about how this safe was built. I have this installed in my garage. It not only came with batteries but screws that allowed me to screw this into a corner of my garage which prevents anyone from just taking this. The safe itself can either be opened by a number code that I was able to set myself or use the keys that comes with this. The safe actually comes with 2 pairs of keys. One set is for the front door of the safe and the other set is for the mini safe that is inside of this safe. Not only am I able to store some important documents but other items that I want to ensure to keep safe. The safe itself is anything but light and did require me to use a hand cart to move this to where I wanted it. The security features of this safe are really great. There are 3 ways to open the safe. The inside can only be opened with the keys though. There is a nice liner inside of the safe too. Great security features and very thick locking bars."
Ronny Acosta,"What I found with these bags is that the syringes that come with these, it takes between 5-7 full syringe fulls to fill these bags. However, this depends on how much you want inside each bag. When it comes to reusing these, I filled these with warm soapy water and was able to fully clean the inside of each bag. I found that as long as a stray is inserted inside of the bags, this helps dry them a lot faster than just leaving them alone as the bag will fall flat and won't dry. The bags themselves don't leak at all and as long as the locks on these are completely locked, no matter how much you move them around, no leaking at all. I can honestly say that these bags are almost realistic as I do work in the medical field. Easy to fill and while you do have to work to get these cleaned out, they are in fact reusable."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about these earbuds is I don't have to have the volume up high in order for them to be completely noise canceling. I will have my volume up at around 25-30% and I won't be able to hear outside of the earbuds. These have been great when it comes to doing online meetings, listening to music, watching movies and really anything else. They connect easily to my phone, tablet, laptop and even my desktop. Once I have these connected, they stay connected without dropping it's signal, unless I'm out of the connection range. Really comfortable to wear for short or long periods of time. Best thing about these is when I have my dual headset on for work, I'm still able to have at least 1 earbud in without anyone noticing or it being uncomfortable."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about these lights is they are actually in the shape of snowflakes and not something that is supposed to look like them. The length of this strand is not only long enough for my window but I was able to go up and down either side too. The lights themselves are fully battery operated and even though they take batteries, they don't kill the batteries fast. I have had the same batteries in these lights since the first day I got them which was almost a month ago. The lights are a bright white color and even during the day, I'm still able to kind of see them, mainly because it's been cloudy. At night, however, that is when you can really see the shapes. Even with these being in my window, you can clearly see them on the outside and even while we're inside. These can definitely be used anywhere since these are battery operated."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about these lights is they can be used anywhere. Personally for me, I bought these for our TV storage unit that has big cabinets but have no lights. These lights were really easy to install and have stickies that attach to the back of the lights and to whatever I want it stuck too. The lights themselves are not only bright enough to light up the dark cabinets but with the remote, it makes it so much easier to turn them on and off when we want to. These are completely battery operated but they did come with batteries which was really helpful. With the lights, we got a total of 6 and 2 remotes. We found that the remotes work for all of the lights. So if you're in the range of the lights with either remote, you can turn these on or off. There are a lot of lighting options that you can choose. We were able to use these for our cabinets and now can see so much better."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about these pieces is you get such a great variety of different items to paint. The backs of these are completely flat which is nice because they can be used as magnets or just paint and play with them. Each layer of these came in their own foam cut out so when they arrived, none of them were broken, cracked or damaged at all. When it comes to painting these, it did come with it's own paint but my kids ended up using their own because we ended up wanting to put 2-3 different coats on some pieces. It did come with brushes but again, we ended up buying a variety brush set. We did use the paint that this came with and it is fully washable. Not to mention, once the pieces were dry, the paint didn't rub off or stain anything. Whether we glued a magnet or a wooden stick in the back, we were able to use a hot glue gun on these and not have them melt or become damaged. Really fun to paint and with as many as you get, you can do practically anything with these. We are currently getting ready to make an under the sea mobile with the sea themed pieces."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about these signs is they are really easy to put up. When they arrived, the sticks that go inside of the signs were separate from the signs. None of the sticks were broken or damaged and neither were the signs. All of them had bright vibrant colors that were printed on them. When it comes to putting them together, the sticks are a little hard to put inside of these at first but once they're in, they don't move around or even come out. I did have to water my yard as it was a little too hard when it came to putting these in. However, once they were in the ground, not even a slight wind storm knocked them over. Even when the sprinklers came on, the signs were not damaged and are completely waterproof. Printed on quality boards that can withstand wind, water and even the sun on them. The great thing about these is they can be reused for the next birthday."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about these watch bands is they are so easy to use. Meaning, I'm able to change out to whichever color I feel like wearing that day easily without it taking up much of my time trying to do so. The bands themselves are really comfortable to use. I will say that if you do accidentally cut the bands, they will eventually tear all the way through, even if the cut wasn't made all the way through. However, do make sure that they are not laying around when cutting things on top of them. Other than that accident, the quality of the bands is really good and no matter how much I move around in these, I have not had any issues with them tearing or ripping on their own. Easy to adjust and easy to switch out too."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this air duster is it's not only easier and better to use than the canister dusters but it cleans so much more than just keyboards. I've been able to use this inside of my car, window sill and even small crevices. The brushes that these comes with really does help to loosen up stuck on dirt and dust. Once loosen, I just use this duster and it's gone. When it comes to the tools, I'm not only able to help loosen up sticky dirt, gunk or dust but I'm also able to clean them with a little soap and warm water. The duster is a lot more powerful than I thought it was but it's definitely been a good thing. While I did use up the battery the first time I used this, charging this duster doesn't take too long. I did have a lot of things to dust or clean out, which is why the battery died kind of fast, however the battery on this does last a very good while."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this bag is it's not only big enough to hold my work uniforms but it's great for just grabbing and going. Where I work, I have to wear full jumpsuit uniforms that can not only be big and bulky but smell too. This laundry bag not only holds those but also my undershirts and anything else I wear under my uniforms. The size of the bag is very convenient when it comes to holding. I already have a lunch bag that is a backpack so with this back strap, I'm able to hold it on my opposite arm of where my lunch bag is. Everything fits inside and even when I take everything to the laundromat to get washed, I'm able to wash this bag with my uniforms. I have been using this for over a month now, getting washed every week and not only is it holding up well, it has absolutely nothing wrong with it. Has a good amount of space and just makes carrying everything so much easier."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this bike rack is that even though I have the connection on my car, I didn't have a hitch for this bike rack but it came with one. The hitch itself is heavy duty and was easy to connect. When it comes to the bike rack, I was able to put 3 bikes on this without any issues. It does say it holds up to 4, but I only have 3 bikes that needed to be held and I was able to do that without it damaging my bikes or my car. The straps on these are really strong and hold the bikes without them moving around too much. Even on not so smooth roads, the bikes still stayed attached to the bike rack itself. The whole setup is heavy duty and not cheap like my old one that rusted out within a month. Even with being near a beach, the rack shows no signs of rusting or falling apart. Even the straps are still holding strong."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this cardigan is how versatile it is. Whether I'm trying to dress up or am going casual and want a cardigan to wear out, I'm able to do so. The fabric is really soft and I love the waffle look the fabric has. At first I wasn't sure if I'd like it but it gives this cardigan some dimension and that little extra something. The quality of the material is really strong and not cheap and thin. While this is great for these chilly breezes we've been having, I wouldn't really recommend this alone on a winter night, unless you were wearing something else to go over. However, for the fall weather, it's absolutely perfect. Even with all the wearing, washing and drying that I've done with this cardigan, it still looks new. Great quality stitching and has definitely held up a lot better than I thought it was going to be, especially after having this for almost 2 months."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this fitness tracker is how comfortable it is. I normally wear just a basic watch but finally upgraded. In order for me to keep track of everything, I did download the app that helps with keeping track of everything but also notifies me when someone messages me, if I'm getting a call and any other notifications I want the watch to send me. When someone calls, my watch will vibrate and show the phone number as if it was on my phone. When it comes to tracking everything from heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen and others things, I can have it check this at the press of a button but if I use the app, that has been the best way I'm able to monitor day to day. The watch is really comfortable to wear and is fully water and sweat proof. Setting everything up on this watch is so easy to do and when I set up the app, I was able to create a profile that helps me keep track of everything without having to write it down. Great watch and the battery lasts a very long time. I have gone 2-3 days without charging this and will still notify me of everything."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this jewelry holder is that I absolutely love the look of it. Not to mention, it doesn't take up a whole lot of space on my dresser. I was looking for something simple but that would still hold my necklaces that I wear often and this is perfect. What I also love about this jewelry holder is that it's like a 2 in 1 type of holder. It not only holds them but when it's time to clean them, the bottom part will actually take care of it. This does come with a plug that helps charge the cleaner. This didn't come with jewelry cleaner which is fine because I have one that I like to use. Once I fill it up, I just open the lid and place the jewelry inside. I then cover the lid and clean it like the instructions state. Once done, I just open the lid and then allow my jewelry to hang and dry. Cleaning the cleaner itself is really easy to rinse out and really does clean my jewelry better than doing it myself. Really simple and easy to use."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this lash wash is that it's great for natural and fake lashes. I had tried this before I got my fake lashes put on to see if I would have any sensitivity to it but nothing. When it came to using for my false ones, what I love about this wash is the brushes that come with this wash don't rip or tear the fake lashes that I have on. I don't have to scrub hard for this wash to work either. When it comes to washing, I do only do one eye at a time but this wash removes anything that is not only on my lash but any eye makeup I might not have gotten off. I now use this to remove my eye makeup because of this. Great quality of wash and only a little is needed."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this leaf blower is it blew my old blower out of the water. While both leaf blowers are battery operated, the other one I have came with a 24V but this 20V not only blows a lot hard but works so much better. My old one seemed that it lacked power, even though it came with 2 24V batteries but I would practically have to be standing on top of the leaves, clipping or anything else I was trying to blow out of my garden. With this blower, if I have it on the highest setting, it feels as though it's raising my arm and will sometimes require me to use 2 hands to hold it. I don't have to be on top of whatever I'm wanting to move but could be 5ft away and it will still blow debris out of my garden. Even though it's only 20V batteries, they really do last a very long time before I have to recharge them. Love that I no longer have to be on top of things and it takes me less time to clean up my mess."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this light projector is how easy it is to use. What I love about this is if I want, I can either suspend this from a tree or have it sit and point towards my wall. What I ended up doing was screwing this into a tree that I have in my front and have it point towards an empty wall on my house. Not only does it come out clear but at night, this looks amazing. The light itself is really bright but doesn't cause any issues with my neighbors or even with a window close by. The lights themselves slowly rotate without moving too fast and making anyone dizzy. The detail of the snowflakes is really clear. I included a video to show what I mean by that and as you can see, you can clearly see the detail of each snowflake that rotates around. Even when moved away from the wall, you can still see the details. Looks great and easy to use."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this meat grinder is the fact that it is so strong and sturdy on my mixer. I purchased one that didn't last more than a week and all I was doing was grinding chicken. With this, I've been using it for about a month and whether I'm grinding meat or making homemade sausages, this meat grinder does the job perfectly. I do have to watch the speed when it comes to making my own sausages, but that has nothing to do with the grinder. I did find that cutting my meat into good portioned cubes helps with the grinding it a lot faster but what I really love is that while it's grinding, if I want, I can add my own seasonings. We use this to make our own ground turkey, chicken and when it comes to making hamburger patties we just add seasons while the meat is grinding up. We even went as far as using this to make churros which was a lot easier than piping the dough out ourselves. When it comes to cleaning, depending on what we used it for, sometimes just soaking it in hot soapy water helps get the fat out a lot better and faster."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this mosquito net is it not only keeps out mosquitoes but flies and any other flying bug as well. The net itself has extremely small openings that still allow you to breathe while inside of this but really does block out any bugs. While you can see mosquitoes and really any bugs outside of the net, there is not a single opening that allows them to get in unless you leave it open long enough to let them inside. We found that if you don't have anywhere to hang this, we used just some stands that help keep it up. We have even sprayed this with bug spray and it doesn't harm the netting itself. Really easy to install and folds easily when it's time to take it down. When we get home from using this, we just hang it out and spray it down to help remove any dirt or debris. Takes no time to dry either. Great quality material and really does protect anyone inside from getting bit."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this popcorn popper is that I'm able to pop any popcorn. However, what I love about this is there are no worries of harsh chemicals. Not to mention, if I want to add any toppings inside of this bowl while the popcorn is popping, I'm able to do so. The other thing I love about this is I'm able to pop as little or as much popcorn as I want. Another convenience is if I want to pop just plain popcorn, I'm also able to do that too. Even if I add sticky caramel inside, nothing sticks to this bowl. Even if it's been sitting inside of the bowl for quite some time and it's hardened, it will doesn't stick to the sides or bottom of the bowl. When it comes to washing this bowl, I have yet had to scrub or leave it in my sink to soak. I can just use a regular sponge and it's all clean. Plus this bowl collapses and is easy to store away too."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this set is that I was needing all of these items in my bathroom. What was great is that all of these matched my more up to date and modern look I did in my bathroom. The black paint on this is a perfect matte color that actually matches my faucets I just purchased. When it came to installing, this set came with everything needed to install these. The towel rack is what really caught my eye. Reason for this is because unlike the more traditional towel rack, I'm actually able to layer towels without having to fold and push them off to each side of the rack. With this rack, I'm able to have one towel in the back and then one in the front. The ring also works great with holding hand towels that I normally hang near my sink. Everything looks great and love the matte black look. Plus, after a month of using, none of the paint has chipped, cracked or peeled off."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this shoe rack is it fits perfectly in our small walk way area but really does help with storing shoes. The rack itself is really sturdy, even on our uneven floors. Putting this together was really easy to do but I ended up using my own tools which made this really easier and faster to put together. The rack fits perfectly in our small walk way without taking up too much space. At first I was worried shoes were going to fall off of this rack but they don't. We found that putting the heels on the bottom really did prevent these shoes from tipping over on the side. My little one has even placed books on this rack and it does hold them really well too. On top, we are able to store whatever we want to place on top and really helps gives us a little more extra storage space. Very sturdy and not a cheap shoe rack. Easy to wipe clean and vacuum when dirt gets on this."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this thermos is I'm able to keep any food in this nice and hot. I had heated up soup the morning I left for work and poured it into this thermos. I took lunch almost 5 hours later and not only was it still hot, but I still had to leave the lid off in order for it to cool off so I could eat it. I didn't have this stored in a refrigerator, but just in my lunch bag that didn't have an ice pack or anything. Even with being inside of my lunch bag, whatever I have inside doesn't leak out of this thermos. I have even put hot chocolate in this and once again, it was nice and hot. The convenient thing about this thermos is it comes with a spoon that folds down and clips onto the lid inside. Really has been coming in handy, especially with the cold weather. Keeps everything hot/warm for a very long time too."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this track suit is that it accentuates all of my curves that I want to accentuate. The pants are really comfortable, which is really great. The stitching on the top perfectly goes under my bust and makes them look a little bigger. There is a corset style piece that goes around the waits but isn't tight like a corset. Both the top and bottom are very stretchy and are not so tight that when I bend over or sit down, they roll up or down. Whether I wash and place in the dryer or hang dry, this top and bottom still have it's olive green color to it. Not to mention, the stitching on this is still holding strong. Love how it looks and really does make the curves pop."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this trash bin is it's not only good for gardening but also when it comes to having small get togethers or parties. We have used 13 and 30 gallon trash bags in this bin and no matter the size, they all seem to fit with no problems. Not to mention, once the trash bag is on the brim of the bin, it does not come off easily, especially when trash is dropped inside of if you push down. This bin is really great to have and hardly takes up any space even when we're done using. After we're done, we have rinsed this out and with a little soap and hosing it out, it's all clean again. Once it's dry, we just collapse it down and it hardly takes up any space in the garage. This really has come in handy in more ways than just for gardening. Great quality on the material and we have not had any issues with anything poking or stabbing through the material."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love about this tray is I wasn't looking for something too big and this size is just perfect. The tray I ordered is white but noticed it also has some gray in it which I absolutely love. It has a great modern chic look to it. When it comes to using, I have some Christmas candles inside of it with some garland and not only is it great for that type of decorations, I'm also able to use it for just any other type of decoration. Since I'm hosting Thanksgiving, I put some fall candles and leaves inside of it and even with the oranges, yellows and browns, this tray still looks great with those decorations too. This arrived on Halloween so I wasn't able to use it for my party, but I've been using it to hold candles and even put a framed picture inside of it and it still looks great. Love that I'm able to put this on my long side table and love that it doesn't take up too much space. Great quality and really easy to clean too."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love best about this bracelet is that it doesn't leak when I add oil or even too much oil. No matter if I have a little bit or accidentally put too much on, it doesn't leak through. The bracelet itself is really comfortable to wear. Normally I have to take off my watch or bracelets when working but found I'm still able to work and type while wearing this bracelet. No matter what I do, this bracelet will still stay on. Even if I wash my hands, this bracelet is still on. Love that this comes different pads that actually match whatever I'm wearing. Plus I found that I'm able to wash the pads which allows me to use different scents without them combining, especially if I don't want them to. Not to mention, the bracelet itself is beautifully designed and is great quality too."
Ronny Acosta,"What I love most about these pillows is that even though my room can get a little stuffy at night, these pillows help keep me nice and cool. Even when there is a portable heater on in my room, I still don't feel as though I'm overheating or anything. Not to mention, the support that these pillows give has been surprisingly comfortable. Usually it takes me a few days or weeks to get used to a pillow but within the first night, I was already comfortable and didn't have to adjust this pillow constantly in order to get comfortable. The pillows themselves fit all of my pillow cases that I have and haven't had any issues with the cases/covers coming off while I'm sleeping. These did come with a cover for each pillow that I was able to throw in my washer and dryer without them tearing or shrinking. Really do keep my cool but more importantly, really comfortable."
Ronny Acosta,"What's convenient about this light is it takes batteries or you can plug the cord that it comes with into any plug, computer, powerbank or really any plug that has a USB on it. The light itself is very detailed when it comes to seeing the unicorn. I included a video to show how it looks when it's on. There is a button on the base that not only allows you to turn it on, but you're able to switch the colors with just a push of the button. The other convenient thing about this light is it comes with a remote. My girls love the light and are able to use the remote to not only turn it to the color they want but are also able to have it stay on and it will change the colors automatically. This is something I did have to show the oldest though. The remote did come with a battery. I also found that cleaning this light is really easy to do. I just use regular glass cleaner and all smudges and finger prints are gone without any streaks. My kids have been using this as their nightlight and on the remote, I'm able to set a timer so it doesn't stay on all night long. Very sturdy base too."
Ronny Acosta,"When I compare these to some old ones that I have, these actually cover and go past my wrists. I recently burnt the top part of my wrist on one of the racks when I was pulling out a casserole. With these oven mitts, I don't have that issue at all. Even with having to make pies, casseroles and really anything, even if I touch any part of the racks on my hands or wrist area, I'm fully covered with these oven mitts. The other thing I love about these is how they're completely slip proof. No matter the type of dish I'm using, when I pull it out of my oven, with these oven mitts, I don't have to worry about it slipping out of my hands because of the rubber grippers on these oven mitts. When they do get dirty, if it's on the rubber area, I'm able to wash them in my sink with just soap and water. If I get the fabric dirty, I just through them in my wash and leave them out to dry. Easy to clean and love that I'm fully protected. Not to mention, I don't feel the heat through the rubber part either."
Ronny Acosta,"When it came to ordering this, I did check the size chart and ended up ordering my size that I normally wear in my shirts. When it arrived, I immediately tried it on and it fit perfectly. Even after washing and hang drying this, it still fit. The shirt itself is really soft, when it comes to the material. I didn't find that it was at all itchy or even see through. The sleeves do come a little past my wrist but that is something that I prefer anyways. The fit on this is perfect, even around the chest and tummy areas. Even when I lift my arms, I don't have any problems with this coming up too high. This shirt is really comfortable to wear whether I'm hanging out around the house or doing errands. No matter how much I've worn and washed this shirt, it still looks new. Great quality material that has shown no signs of tearing, ripping or becoming see through. So great, I'm ordering more in the other colors."
Ronny Acosta,"When it comes to helping my child with the hands on toy and has been really helpful for cognitive learning. When it comes to figuring out how to put it together, I was able to help show them but when it comes to making the different shapes and building this up, it not only helped but made them stop and figure out on how to do so. Rather than just putting building blocks together and stacking, this actually helped with how to turn these to make these go up and with all the different angles. While my child has mild autism, this has been helping them with their cognitive development, which was what I was hoping and going for. What I love about these, if they get dirty, I'm able to easily clean them. They did come inside of a carrying container which is very helpful when it comes to storing these away. Great for any age and any developing age, but mainly great for cognitive learning."
Ronny Acosta,"When it comes to installing this elliptical, everything came perfectly packaged and I even included a picture of how the tools and screws came packaged. The instructions were perfectly clear and I do suggest doing step by step because there is a reason when it comes to putting everything together. What I love about this elliptical is that it not only monitors my heart rate but will keep track of how long I've been going with mileage. This elliptical is very conveniently made because when I want to add to the tension, I'm able to do so right in front of me rather than looking down and twisting a dial. When this goes up in tension, it really does go up. The feeling is similar to walking up a bunch of stairs. I didn't think I was going to sweat and workout as much with this elliptical, as I bought this to replace an old one, but this one really does give you a workout. Since using this, for almost 2 months now, I have lost a total of 13lbs, but this also includes me changing my diet. However, I am seeing more muscle tone in my legs, arms and in my waist. Really does give you a workout."
Ronny Acosta,"When it comes to installing this fan, I was able to easily change this out with my old fan. It came with everything that was needed to not only change it out but to ensure that it stays in place on my ceiling. Even with this turned on high, this fan doesn't wobble, squeak or cause the whole fan to move but just spin on high. The remote really does come in handy, considering I have vaulted ceilings and am unable to reach anything if it did have a cord. From start to finish, this took me about 45 minutes to change out my old fan with this fan. When it comes to using, the blades on this have a good curve that actually pushes the air around rather than just cutting it through and barely pushing anything out. The light on this can get really bright or even dim, but still allows us to see whether it's completely dark or has some light coming in from outside. Even with the light on, it doesn't make our room warmer than what it normally is. I have cleaned this fan and found that it's so much easier to clean than some wooden blades that I used to have. Easy to install and really does push the air around the room. When comparing this to our older fan, our once stuffy and hot living room/den is actually colder and doesn't smell stale. Energy efficient and has helped with cutting our electricity bill with our air conditioning unit."
Ronny Acosta,"When it comes to setting these nets up, they're so easy to use. I just took one out of the bag, and I was able to hang it up in my tree. The tray on the inside can be filled with any sort of liquid or solid waste to help attract flies and other insects. With the weather still warm we are still dealing with mosquitos biting us as soon as we go outside. I was able to make a mixture of salt water and put it inside of the dish. from there, I just hung it up. While the netting has small holes, they're not big enough that once a mosquito flies in, they can't escape out. We were even able to hang these in our backyard and not only did we catch mosquitos but flies as well. It does depend on what you put inside of the tray. With the ones for flies, we put some fruit scraps inside and a couple of pieces of hot dogs. When it's time to clean it out, we just dump everything out in a bag, wash the cup and reuse. It does smell, but everything washes out with no problems."
Ronny Acosta,"When it comes to using these lights, I'm able to use either the remote that comes with it or I can just use the app on my phone. The remote allows me to change the color, brightness and how they twinkle. However, when it comes to using the app, there are so many other different ways I'm able to make these lights work. I'm able to change the mood, how they twinkle, use the lights to display a design, have them go along with the music I play and so much more. While the remote is great for when I just want to turn them on, I mainly use the app because of all the features that it offers. These lights are so easy to maneuver and adjust when it comes to decorating or making them into any design. I have not only been able to use these for Halloween, but a few birthday parties too. Can't wait to use them for the upcoming holidays."
Ronny Acosta,"When this arrived, I thought I was going to have to put this whole thing together but turns out, I didn't have to do anything like that. The scooter arrived folded inside of a box that was completely protected, even if the box was slightly dented and bent. When the scooter is folded down, it makes for not only easy storage but we're able to fit this inside of our trunk or even inside of our trailer for when we go camping. Not only does my kid have fun with this scooter, but I was even able to test this out myself. The brakes on this scooter really does make the scooter stop on a dime. The steering is really easy and I was able to take any turn. Really sturdy and a lot of fun to ride. The cool part on this scooter is the wheels really do light up when riding. While you can't see it a lot during the day, you can clearly see them at night."
Ronny Acosta,"When this arrived, the one thing I noticed is that the bag was really thick and had some weight to it. When further inspection, the fabric itself is really thick and strong. I was able to put skateboards, scooters and even sporting equipment inside of this bag. No matter how much movement from inside of the bag, the bag itself is really strong and has not shown any signs of tearing or wearing down. I do have a roof rack on top of my SUV and the straps are really to strap them to. At first I was afraid that the weight of the items that I have inside the bag was going to tear the straps but this has yet to happen. I use this cargo bag not only every weekend but even during the week. I have had this bag for over a month now and this bag is still holding strong. There are no signs of it tearing or ripping. The other great thing about this bag is it doesn't scratch up my car either. Great quality of material and super strong. It may be dirty but even after rinsing it off, I've watched the water just drip down and when I check inside of the bag, it was completely dry. Definitely waterproof and strong enough to hold almost anything we put inside."
Ronny Acosta,"When this first arrived, I had a planned camping trip and decided to take it to really test it out. Where we were camping, there was a nearby lake and creek. I was able to get this wet and it did not mess up or have anything wrong with it after I pulled it out of the water. The depth of the water I put this in was roughly about 3-4 inches deep, nothing too deep. Along the lake, I was able to find a lot of change and other pieces of metal. However, in the creek, I was able to find a few rings. When it comes to using this on land, again, I found old change, metal stakes and even some old jewelry. I used this at some local parks and again, found a good amount of stuff. The deepest I was able to find stuff was just about a foot deep. Really easy to use and surprisingly, this was not that heavy. I do have an old shoulder injury that normally will hurts just using my leaf blower but not with this metal detector."
Ronny Acosta,"When this first arrived, I noticed it was really flat due to the packaging. I decided to wet the skirt in the tub and then I rung out the water and hung it out to dry. After it was dry, I took a wide tooth comb to help brush out the fluff, but found putting this in the dryer on a low temp made this come out even fluffier. When I placed it under one of my trees, I noticed it almost looks like snow under my tree. The skirt itself is really soft and easy to use. It does come flat but when it comes to getting it wet and then placing it in my dryer on the low setting, I found that this really helps fluff it out. Even with it being on my floor, I'm able to vacuum it without damaging it but I don't use the brushes on the skirt. Looks really nice and love how it feels. I've even caught my cats sleeping on it."
Ronny Acosta,"Where I work at, I take my lunch in my car due what is currently going on. Rather than risking making a mess all over myself, this car tray helps with that. It not only holds my food for me but also a drink since it's taking up a cup holder. The space that this tray offers is a lot bigger than I thought I was going to get. What I love is that I'm able to put my food on this tray, my drink and also my cell phone. I also found that when it comes to using while driving, rather than keeping my fries in between my legs and risking the chance that they fall, this tray will hold them. The pad on the tray itself prevents anything from slipping and sliding around. Whether I'm parked or driving, this tray has been used a lot more than I thought it was going to be. Easy to install in the cup holder and once it's locked in place, it doesn't move or come loose at all."
Ronny Acosta,"Whether I'm in the car, on a trip or even at home, these earbuds are great. The sound quality is crystal clear and can get a little loud if the volume is too high. These can definitely be noise canceling earbuds, but that does depend on how high you turn them up too. When it comes to charging, I love that on the case, it let's me know how much battery life is left in the earbuds. If I use 1 more than the other, it will actually show that on the light display next to the percentage of battery life. Not to mention, it will show that if I'm charging one or both earbuds on this same display. Very convenient rather than constantly guessing if I have enough power to last me. The case is small enough to fit inside of my pocket and overall, the charging cord it comes with does charge these very fast. I'm also able to pause and play my music with just the touch on the side of the earbuds. Really comfortable to wear too."
Ronny Acosta,"While I don't have 10 people in my family, we still have half of that amount and we were all able to fit inside of this tent with room. What's great about this tent, is it not only fit the whole family but still had room left over for our luggage, sleeping bags, pillows, extra shoes and a few other items we would keep inside. Not to mention, even with all of us inside, we never once got too hot or stuffy inside. The mesh windows on this not only allowed air to flow through this but there are enough that there is no reason for you to get stuffy in this tent. To put up, it took roughly about 10 minutes the first time and just a bit under that after that. There is a center divider but even with that, we were still able to have our air mattress, sleeping pads and even 1 small cot that fit inside on one of the trips we took. We have used this tent several times since it's arrived and no matter how many times we've used it, the tent still works and looks great. Fully waterproof too."
Ronny Acosta,"While I have taken this on many trips, I am currently using this on one right now. We have been kayaking, hiking, just walking around local areas and not only as this been used to charge phones, but even though it has gotten wet, it is still currently working. This charger came with a D ring that I've been able to clip onto any backpack or even a life jacket. What I love about this charger is not only does it charge phones fairly fast but the flashlight has really helped for being able to see anywhere it's been dark. We took an evening bike ride and ended up getting rained on in the middle. Even though this solar panel was hanging on the outside of my backpack, it is still currently working thanks to the cover that covers the plugs is completely insulated and prevents any water from getting inside. We were even able to use the flashlight during the rain and not once did it flicker or turn off while getting wet. Great quality and lasts a really long time before it needs to be recharged."
Ronny Acosta,"While I only needed 1 of these poles, not only was it strong and secure but even after leaving this up, this pole is still standing. We did move this several times and not matter how many times we have taken this out of the ground and move it to another spot, this pole is very sturdy. Even with the ground being wet, through rain and a heavy wind storm, this pole is still standing. Not to mention, after the moving this around and after the rain we had, I checked this to see if it was rusting and there are no rust spots anywhere. This pole is really easy to install and if need be, can be taken apart for easy storage. However, when up, it is very strong and sturdy as long as the bottom is pushed in all of the way. Even the paint is still on this pole."
Ronny Acosta,"While I'm new to installing these types of things onto my car, after reading the instructions and watching a video, I had this fully installed on my camera in under an hour. When it came to installing, since I am new, it did take me a bit but the instructions this came with were actually really easy to follow. The video just helped me because I'm more of a visual learner when it comes to things like this. The camera quality on the screen is really clean and clear. The suction cup perfectly attaches onto my dash and doesn't really move unless I unlock it. What is really helpful are the lines that this camera provides. Not only am I able to see who is behind me but when it comes to parking, I'm able to see if I'm in a parking spot and how close I am to walls or anything else behind me. I did have to clean the lens of the camera after it rained but that was an easy fix. Even with the camera acting as a license plate cover, you can still clearly see my license and my stickers."
Ronny Acosta,"While the rope part was taken apart first, the toy itself is still in 1 single piece. I have a lab mix, chihuahua and a new puppy who is about the same size as the chihuahua. No matter what dog plays with this toy, it has lasted through all 3 of them. Our chihuahua has been known to tear up these types of toys in a matter of days or in a couple of weeks but after having this for over a month, its still in one piece. No signs of cracking either. This toy has been outside, has been cleaned and even tossed around. Even through all of that, this toy not only looks somewhat new but still even squeaks. Even with the new puppy teething and chewing everything, not only are they able to get their mouth on this but they have yet to tear this apart. Even the rope part is all still attached to the toy itself."
Ronny Acosta,"While this did arrive kind of flattened, I was able to puff it up in order to make it pop out. The ribbons themselves have wires in them which allowed me to make them pop out as far out or just as little as I want. While I don't have this out right now, I was able to put this onto my Christmas wreath. The bow itself not only fit onto my oversized door wreath, but the extra ribbon that hangs down allowed me to not only tie it to the back but I was even able to fully decorate my wreath with the extra ribbon. I did glue this to my wreath. I did use my hot glue gun and even with the hot glue on the ribbon, it did not melt or disfigure any of the ribbon itself. This bow is really easy to maneuver around and looks so much better in person than it does online. Can be used for really any sort of decorating but absolutely love this on my wreath."
Ronny Acosta,"While this did have barely there instructions on how to put this together, once I pulled everything out of the box, I realized that it's really a simple and basic pizza oven that had the same size screws for everything. The instructions were simple enough that once I saw everything, I could see why they were basic. The pizza oven itself does require pellets and found that depending on the type of pellets really kind of determines the flavoring you get. When it comes to cooking pizza, the pizza stone was really helpful when it comes to cooking any types of pizza. We first tried frozen pizza and we were able to cook this completely but found it's best to turn it every so often to ensure one side doesn't get burned. We even tried homemade pizza and again, you do have to monitor it. When we removed the stone, we decided to try to smoke/cook some fish with the other tray that this came with. Once again, everything did require us to monitor but everything came out so juicy and flavorful. Cooking with this pizza oven is so easy and simple. The oven itself is heavy, especially when the pizza stone is inside of this. The smoke pipe has angled top that helps divert the smoke that comes out away. When done, really easy to open the back and dump the ash. We did have a table setup for our flat top and this fits on top of it with no problems. The whole oven itself is really sturdy, even with opening and closing the door. As long as you monitor your food, everything comes out perfectly cooked and full of flavor."
Ronny Acosta,"With this set of beads, what I love is that it comes with so many different ones that you can practically create anything that you want to with them. The cord/string that comes with this is stretchy and anything but cheap. While it has stretch to it, even with the slight stretch, it doesn't break or stretch out easily. The amount of beads that comes with is absolutely amazing, especially for how much I paid for this kit. I bought this for me and my kids so we can create whatever we wanted that got us off of our phones and tablets and this was definitely the best way to do it. While we did end up having to buy more string and cords because we ended up running out, we were also able to use pleather cord, small chains, hoops and hemp cord with these beads. No matter what we use, we were able to still pull cords through and even use jump rings with some of these. So easy to use and you get so much that you can really create anything and not just jewelry. We were even able to use some of these with some resin too."
Outdoor Enthusiast,YKK makes great zippers and so I was expecting the plastic buckles to perform well too. Indeed they do. Feels solid and clips together well.
Outdoor Enthusiast,"You might wonder, what is the difference between Shaved Ice and Shaved Snow? The former is commonly associated with Hawaiian whereas the latter with Chinese/Taiwanese. The Snow version is very fluffy (like snow) and Shaved Ice is literally -- like ice broken to small bits. Both are delicious. This machine makes Shaved Ice/Snow cones. You simply throw ice cubes into the collection container at top, select the ice thickness via the front knob, and watch the resulting ice come out from the bottom. Then add your favorite syrup and/or scoop of ice cream (Macademia!) and enjoy. The THINNEST setting, however, does not appear to work well unless you have a large amount of ice in the collector. For best results, allow the ice cubes to sit in room temperature for 5-10 minutes before throwing them into the collector so the ice can be shaved a bit more finely. If you can crush the cubes first for even more thinness. Expect a lot of banging noise as the cubes are spun around inside the collector, especially as it nears empty. Shaved Snow, on the other hand, does not use ice cubes. They instead use ice BLOCKS that are then run through a shaver to produce those fluffy, light, sheets of melt-in-your-mouth ""snow"". You then adorn those with syrup and/or fruit. The first time you use this Vivohome ice shaver, be sure to make a couple runs with water (and later with ice cubes) to wash off any chemical residues. In our case, we found a LOT of rubber debris that washed out onto the water collection tray. You could also see some in the ice collection bucket at the top. Vivohome engineering assured me that this was normal and that it would go away after a few cleanup runs. Indeed it did. Another negative I found is that the water collector is drained by removing a plastic/silicone plug that could easily be lost. I wish it was attached to the machine itself somehow, but thankfully, the company included an extra plug. Draining the collector also required me to tilt forward the machine a bit to get rid of the remaining water, but that would also result in some coming out of where the shaved ice outputs from (due to remaining water in the top collector falling through the blade opening). Other than that, it had quickly and continuously created multiple shaved ice that our kids and neighbors enjoyed during the hot, California heat (and it's only Spring time!)"
